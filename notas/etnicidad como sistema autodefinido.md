# etnicidad como sistema autodefinido

>Irrespective of the many permutations discussed here, a conceptualization of ethnic groups as self-defining systems, and an emphasis on the fluid and situational nature of both group boundaries and individual identification, has prevailed in the last two to three decades. Within this broad generic definition, the analysis of particular ethnic groups has been largely concerned with the perception and expression of group boundaries; ethnicity is considered to be a consciousness of identity vis-à-vis other groups—a ‘we’/ ‘they’ opposition. The incorporation of a definition of ethnic groups as self- defining systems within a theoretical framework focusing on boundary maintenance, the situational aspects of ethnic identification, and the movement of personnel across boundaries, has facilitated the analysis of the social dimensions of ethnic groups and filled a theoretical void in the analysis of inter-group relations.
