## Resumen
It doesn't matter what subject you teach, differences in students performance are affected by how much they engage in deliberate practice. Researchers who have investigated expert and novice performance have uncovered important distinctions between deliberate practice and other activities, such as play or repetition. Deliberate practice is not the same as rote repetition. Rote repetition — simply repeating a task — will not by itself improve performance. Deliberate practice involves attention, rehearsal and repetition and leads to new knowledge or skills that can later be developed into more complex knowledge and skills. Although other factors such as intelligence and motivation affect performance, practice is necessary if not sufficient for acquiring expertise (Campitelli & Gobet, 2011).

### §  General recommendations for practice and instruction

Research (Anderson, 2008; Campitelli & Gobet, 2011; Ericsson, Krampe, & Clemens, 1993) suggests several conditions that must be in place in order for practice activities to be most effective in moving students closer to skillful performance. Each of these conditions can be met with carefully designed instruction:

- Because practice requires intense, focused effort, students may not find it inherently enjoyable. Therefore, teachers can **encourage students** to practice more by pointing out every time that practice has actually improved their performance. Motivate your students to practice by:
    - Expressing confidence in students' ability to succeed in solving practice problems.
    - Designing activities that maximize opportunities for students to succeed.
- Teachers should design practice tasks with **students existing knowledge** in mind. When students succeed at practice problems, the benefits of practice are maximized. But when students become frustrated with unrealistic or poorly designed practice problems, they often lose motivation, will not receive the full benefits of the practice they have done, and will be less motivated to attempt future practice problems.
- Students receive the greatest benefits from practice when teachers provide them with **timely and descriptive feedback**.
- Students should have **repeated opportunities** to practice a task through practicing other tasks like it.
