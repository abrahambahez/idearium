Frustration is also common. Designing the organization of the future is a difficult, sometimes messy project of trial and error, not an exercise on paper. It is a continuous, dynamic, and, in a sense, never-ending process. Yet for companies that rise to the challenge, the payoff can be immense in terms of financial performance, productivity, employee engagement, and a host of other benefits. (cap. Introduction, parr. 8)

Research shows that we spend two orders of magnitude more time with people near our desk than with those more than 50 meters away.1 Whatever a hierarchical organization chart says, real, day-to-day work gets done in networks. This is why the organization of the future is a “network of teams”

Top companies are built around systems that encourage teams and individuals to meet each other, share information transparently, and move from team to team depending on the issue to be addressed. Different networks can have different specialties, such as innovation or getting to market quickly, but the principle is the same.

For a company to stay agile, teams must be formed and disbanded quickly. High-performing companies today may build a “digital customer experience” group, select individuals for the team, and ask them to design and build a new product or service in a year or two. Afterward, the team disperses as team members move on to new projects. This ability to move between teams without risk is a critical attribute of today's high-performing companies. (sec. The power of networks of teams, parr. 2-4)

High-performing companies often first develop these flexible models at the “edge” of the company. To make further progress, they focus on building a new leadership mind-set that rewards innovation, experimentation, learning, and customer-centric design thinking.2 In short, if what a company needs to know and do is constantly changing, then the organization's structure must change as well. (sec. Starting at the Edge, parr. 2)

One promising technique is organizational network analysis (ONA), which uses specialized software and methodologies to help companies study “who is talking to whom.” This type of analysis, which can use patterns in emails, instant messages, physical proximity, and other data, allows leaders to see quickly what networks are in place and identify the connectors and experts. (sec. Next step: Building the organization of the future, parr. 2)

In fact, one objective of an agile network is to use goal-setting to support success.

In teams, accountability becomes more transparent. Individual and team goals and metrics should be shared for everyone to see. (sec. Building in accountability parr. 1-2)
