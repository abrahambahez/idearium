## Resumen

"Stanford d.school directors Jeremy Utley and Perry Klebahn show leaders how to dramatically boost business results by amplifying the creative output of their organizations, drawing from their popular Stanford courses. The number of new ideas a team can generate in a given amount of time correlates directly to its capacity to solve problems and devise breakthrough solutions. This is ideaflow, and companies like Apple, Amazon, and Toyota dominate because they have far more of it. Ideaflow is the most crucial business metric because every business problem is fundamentally an idea problem. When ideas are scarce, so are profits. Your team's capacity to quickly and efficiently generate enough potential solutions, as well as design, test, and launch winning products and services, is decisive. Drawing from decades spent helping Silicon Valley entrepreneurs and Fortune 500 executives, as well as leadership roles at innovative companies, Klebahn and Utley offer a battle-tested framework to exponentially boost ideaflow in yourself and your team. You'll learn how to: Strengthen creative output with a brief daily practice Rapidly generate a flood of new ideas under enormous pressure Run cheap, fast, and efficient real-world tests of your ideas to choose the 10x winners Encourage and incentivize ideaflow across teams and organizations Are you ready to supercharge your organization's results?"â€“
