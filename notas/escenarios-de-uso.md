# escenarios de uso
Los escenarios de uso son una [[estrategia-metodologica]] usada en el contexto de la [[etnografia-digital]], de acuerdo con @pinketal2016 [p. 116]:

>Along with standard interview techniques, Hjorth used the ‘scenarios of use’ method – a deep interviewing technique, developed with Michael Arnold – that involves reviewing a participant’s typical day from the moment they wake up until the moment they go to sleep. Participants are asked to share information about when they use media and why, with interviewers asking further questions about the detail of the everyday and mundane. Interviews often last for two to three hours. Scenarios of use and re-enactments assist discussion of some of the tacit and familiar practices that can be overlooked in ordinary interviews. Alongside the scenarios of use method, participants were also asked to collate a diary over a month, including visual images such as screen shots, so that the researcher could gain a sense of some of the key phone applications that participants were using, as well as how and why they used them.
