# Tourism and the Transformation of Daily Life Along the Riviera Maya of Quintana Roo, Mexico'

Markus Pi-Sunyer (2015)

[pueblo-maya](pueblo-maya.md) y [modo-de-vida](modo-de-vida.md) "En el espacio de menos de dos décadas, los habitantes de Quintana Roo han tenido que enfrentar cambios radicales ocasionados por el turismo de masas. El turismo se ha convertido en la industria dominante y esto ha puesto en marcha un ciclo de desarrollo tur ́stico y de migraci ́o n masiva de otras partes de M ́e xico y del exterior. Una regi ́o n que no hace mucho tiempo se consideraba el territorio m ́a s marginal de la naci ́o n, hoy atrae millones de turistas de todo el mundo, la mayor ́a de los Estados Unidos y Europa. En un contexto de cambio acelerado y control empresarial, la vida de muchas personas, incluso la poblaci ́o n maya, es altamente imprevisible y estresante. La expansi ́o n del turismo se ha desplazado recientemente a Tulum, una ciudad que est ́a emergiendo como una localidad de peque ̃n os, pero bien c ́o modos, hoteles." (Pi-Sunyer :1)

"is both a longitudinal study, summarizing findings over almost two decades of investigation, and a discussion of how changing circumstances influenced our research agenda." (Pi-Sunyer :2)

"Phase 1 (1993-94) examined the impact of different forms of tourism on Maya villages and resort service communities. Phase 2 (2000-01) shifted attention to the town and tourist destination of Tulum. Here, we sought out the principal groups influencing change and examined their role in resource conflicts. Phase 3 (2008-09) took one of these conflict arenas, environmental protection versus intensified development, and explored the seriousness of environmental degradation. In essence, our research demonstrates how tourism alters everyday life, contributes to the complexity of rapid change in an increasingly diverse setting, and how these processes are influenced by national policy and global economy. Methods included participant observation, interviews with local and regional key informants, questionnaires, and focus groups." (Pi-Sunyer :2)

"ourism and its offshoots have come to influence, even define, most spheres of local life. It is a reality that cannot be avoided." (Pi-Sunyer :2)

"economics and politics do not constitute distinct phenomena and that we "cannot understand any social system without knowing how both power and production are organized"" (Pi-Sunyer :2)

"our approach to environmental issues is guided by political ecology: a concern regarding inequalities in access to, and management of, environmental resources, and support of indigenous ecological practices" (Pi-Sunyer :3)

"the changes taking place in the state of Quintana Roo also reflected profound changes taking place in Mexican society. Mexico's economy has been shifting to services and the manufacturing of items such as cars, computers, and appliances." (Pi-Sunyer :3)

"over fifteen years ago many young Maya couples considered two children to be the ideal family, and would encourage their daughters to finish school before they even thought of getting married." (Pi-Sunyer :3)

### Tourism and its Repercussions (note on p.3)

"The tourism phenomenon was altering the lives of Maya agriculturalists in a variety of ways." (Pi-Sunyer :3)

"Maya villagers were rapidly moving into a cash economy, partly due to a succession of storms and bad harvests, but also because of lifestyle changes and the attraction of consumer" (Pi-Sunyer :3)

"goods: medicines, school books, TV sets, soft drinks, and other processed food" (Pi-Sunyer :4)

"the shape of lived experience was being materially and imaginatively reconfigured through tourism, not just for tourists but also for local residents" (Pi-Sunyer :4)

"We were witnessing the expansion of the Canc ́u n model and the small town of Tulum was growing by leaps and bounds" (Pi-Sunyer :4)

"For three centuries of Spanish rule this region was virtually unknown . . . Later, it served as a place of refuge for the Maya Indians who, in 1847, rebelled against the domination of the whites" (Pi-Sunyer :4)

"The Two Milpas of Chan Kom" (Pi-Sunyer :5)

"ny Quintana Roo Maya of my age remembers a time when Maya communities of that beautiful state were isolated and self-sufficient. Their grandfathers remembered a time when Quintana Roo was, de facto, an independent country" (Anderson n.d.:1; also see Hostettler 1996)" (Pi-Sunyer :5)

### The construction of Mass Tourism (note on p.5)

"In the late 1970s, Mexico launched what some economists term "the tourism export push"" (Pi-Sunyer :5)

"The Riviera Maya now generates about one-third of Mexico's tourism income, and tourism has become the country's most important export industry.3 Hence, what occurs on this coast is a matter of vital national interest" (Pi-Sunyer :5)

"In 1950, the total population numbered but 26,967 inhabitants, and as recently as 1960 it had grown to just over 50,000; of these, about half spoke an indigenous language. Today, the total population of the state is well over one million" (Pi-Sunyer :5)

"The Canc ́u n model was planned" (Pi-Sunyer :5)

"Following the creation of a brand new resort city was an" (Pi-Sunyer :5)

"international airport and the key north-south coastal highway" (Pi-Sunyer :6)

"hose early years is the omnipresent atmosphere of "development,"" (Pi-Sunyer :6)

"For planners and bureaucrats in Mexico City, the expansion southward of tourist venues not only made economic sense and provided employment, but also advanced Mexico's image as a modernizing country." (Pi-Sunyer :6)

"we saw development primarily as a statesponsored process, a model generated by technicians and bureaucrats, as distinct from change grounded in the history and experience of local society" (Pi-Sunyer :6)

""post-development." This can be described as a critique of the harm—economic, political, cultural—that mainstream development paradigms have visited in countries and societies, and how this approach may be countered" (Pi-Sunyer :6)

Pérdida de recursos madereros para los campesinos mayas y sobre todo pérdida de tierras para la construcción de megadesarrollos (note on p.6)

"But the massive migratory movement, whether internal or external, responds to something universal: the felt needs of people in search of a livelihood" (Pi-Sunyer :6)

"Today indigenous people are a decreasing presence in their ancestral land, and this trend is unlikely to change" (Pi-Sunyer :6)

"In our case, the primary commodity is the physical space and its uses. With some exceptions, the human flow comes from two directions: relatively well-to-do members of what is termed the "developed world," and management and labor catering to the tourist trade." (Pi-Sunyer :7)

"Beaches and forests, particularly the former, are the bread and butter of tropical coastal tourism. Quintana Roo also offers numerous ancient Maya locations, one of them the Tulum archaeological site minutes away from Tulum pueblo. This rather modest site has become one of the most visited prehispanic locations in the Mexican Republic" (Pi-Sunyer :7)

"What has made it iconic and a cash cow for the Mexican state is the setting: an accessible Maya "ruin" overlooking the azure Caribbean." (Pi-Sunyer :7)

"within a context of generalized poverty, extreme and growing economic inequality became the norm" (Pi-Sunyer :8)

"ndigenous people, who generally lived in the interior, were increasingly both pulled and pushed into this tourism-based labor market" (Pi-Sunyer :8)

"If the population of Quintana Roo has increased dramatically, it is because of tourism demands, and that so many people desperately sought work" (Pi-Sunyer :8)

"Nationally, tourism now generates a fourth of Mexico's foreign revenue" (Pi-Sunyer :8)

"If Michel Foucault could pay a visit to the Riviera Maya, he would not be surprised at this example of how power is deployed in the modern world, and is most clearly manifested by "the distribution of bodies in space"" (Pi-Sunyer :8)

"The developmental model we are discussing, from airports to hotels, is by definition massive in scale" (Pi-Sunyer :9)

"a global template: "The space inside these complexes invariably included a swimming pool, a garden with restaurants, bars, shops and diverse entertainment spaces. The gardens also . . . . staged a lush nature with different types of tropical flowers . . . . and access to the beach" (Picard 2011:144)" (Pi-Sunyer :9)

"the shape of tourism imagery is strongly influenced by travel-related mass-media formats including guidebooks, travel brochures, and television programs. Much of thismaterialreinforcesaquasi-colonialconceptualizationofabinaryworlddivided into modern-traditional, us-them, and western-nonwestern components. This, in her opinion, constitutes "the darker side of tourism as a realm of imagining" (Caton 2012:123)" (Pi-Sunyer :9)

### The maya Past-Present (note on p.9)

"Long before the advent of mass tourism, Maya people in Quintana Roo had experienced the massive appropriation of land and resources. In 1937, the inhabitants of Tulum, then a small Maya hamlet," (Pi-Sunyer :9)

"were forced to cede the archaeological site to the National Anthropological and Historical Institute (INAH), a government agency. This was not just displacement, but the loss of a sacred site that attracted pilgrims from Maya communities far and near (Balam Ramos 2010:76-77; Go ̃n i 1999:163-168). Some decades later, the people of Cob ́a lost a good deal of their productive land as INAH took control of its archaeological site and environs." (Pi-Sunyer :10)

"How do people manage, or attempt to manage, these drastic and powerful shifts and changes?" (Pi-Sunyer :10)

"norms of reciprocity and social solidarity" (Pi-Sunyer :10)

"communal agricultural work has increasingly been superseded by wage labor employment, and this trend is likely to continue" (Pi-Sunyer :10)

"already in 1994 at least one-third of able-bodied men in Cob ́a looked for employment outside the community, and an estimated 40 percent of working-age villagers derived some income from tourism. What has not taken place in Cob ́a and other interior villages is an abandonment of agriculture." (Pi-Sunyer :10)

"Another tool deployed by Maya people for managing the strains of uncertain times also harks back to the past. It takes several forms, but all have their roots in the religious practices that emerged following the Spanish Conquest" (Pi-Sunyer :11)

"This "remembering" is also related to the mid-19th century "Talking Cross" Maya uprising that began in central Quintana Roo and came close to defeating the Mexican army. Talking Crosses proliferated, and the archaeologist Michael Coe saw one inside the Tulum archaeological site (then a local shrine) as recently as 1948 (Coe 2011:258). Mexican control was not established until 1901, but this faded during the subsequent decades. Today Maya religious practices have come under pressure from another direction: foreign missionaries, mostly American and evangelical. In some instances, this has caused serious community divisions" (Pi-Sunyer :11)

### Friction in Tulum (note on p.11)

"Anna Tsing's Friction. Friction, she writes, aids us in understanding the unexpected and apparently contradictory: "how emergent cultural forms - including forest destruction and environmental advocacy - are persistent but unpredictable effects of global encounters across difference" (Tsing 2005:3)" (Pi-Sunyer :11)

"In and around Tulum, a clear indication of friction is how the privatization and commoditization of land, and the transformation of communal land into private property, has led to the massive sale of former rural leaseholds." (Pi-Sunyer :11)

"Yuri Balam Ramos documents the extent to which the Maya community has been influenced by the economic and demographic transformation experienced by the town. Perhaps expectedly, one assumes that indigenous people are "traditional," however, Maya residents seized the opportunity to benefit from a very significant change: private ownership of what had been communal land" (Pi-Sunyer :12)

"Countless times Maya friends have explained to us that Tulum is a Maya settlement, a distinct place with a distinct history. But regardless of the fact that it holds special meanings, and even sacred qualities (it shelters one of the five Maya churches in Quintana Roo), deep human feelings are at times confronted by social and demographic realities." (Pi-Sunyer :12)

### Maya Imagination and Reality (note on p.12)

"the way that "Maya" is generally conceptualized has little to do with the past, and much more with the present" (Pi-Sunyer :13)

"More broadly, the majority of the people we talked to, including resident foreigners, viewed the Maya presence favorably." (Pi-Sunyer :13)

"Magal ́ Daltabuit undertook a household survey supporting our impression that most residents felt an attachment to the town." (Pi-Sunyer :13)

"In 2000, the town had 6,733 inhabitants, about a third of its current population. The demographic profile has not changed much: typically young, many recently arrived, and often minimally educated. In the survey, some 25 percent of those over 25 years of age had attended elementary school, and about the same portion had received secondary education. What we have, therefore, is a growing town, still quite new, where most people work long shifts for relatively little money or sense of security." (Pi-Sunyer :13)

"In his ethnography of Tulum, Balam Ramos differentiates between four distinct ethnicities (his term) in the composition of Tulum's population: Mayas descended from the original insurgent Maya settlement whom we have termed "Tulum Maya"; Maya people who are relatively recent migrants from the state of Yucat ́a n and elsewhere; non-Maya Mexicans from other parts of the country; and finally a substantial number of foreigners, predominantly Europeans and North Americans" (Pi-Sunyer :14)

"ow-income women in Tulum are challenged to provide their families with healthy meals." (Pi-Sunyer :15)

### The Ecological Imperative (note on p.15)

"Environmentally important or fragile areas often lack adequate protection," (Pi-Sunyer :16)

"The main issue is the control and oversight of a voracious tourist industry, but there are plenty of other matters that require attention. An important one for an emergent activist civil society is the role of asymmetrical relations "where decisions remain in the hands of a small elite composed of high federal and state officials and a consortium of directors from major national and foreign corporations"" (Pi-Sunyer :16)

"Working in the small Maya community of Tres Reyes abutting the biosphere reserve, Mart ́nez-Reyes (2014; also Macip 2012) describes the failure of a state-sponsored wildlife management program due to a lack of coherence between the objectives of the state, NGOs, and the community, but, most significantly, problems arose from ethnic relations that reproduced conditions of inequality" (Pi-Sunyer :17)

"Now that the NGOs have been evicted, villagers can carry out their own conservation plans" (Pi-Sunyer :17)

"The efforts of the environmental movement in Quintana Roo, and the success it has achieved in protecting threatened locations take us back, if indirectly, to the matter of inseguridad. Fear is often a component as in inseguridad ciudadana, the lack of safety in public spaces. However, there is also inseguridad of other forms such as economic anxiety (jobs, income, etc.), and the growing frequency of catastrophic storms, particularly in rural communities lacking storm shelters." (Pi-Sunyer :17)

### Present—Future (note on p.18)

"While a range of tourist venues and attractions is a welcomed shift in that it offers greater choice to visitors and the opportunity to participate in the tourist trade for the owners of relatively small businesses, it does not significantly change the dominance of the development industry over matters of environmental and social justice" (Pi-Sunyer :19)

"We pondered these inequalities with reference to different components of the population, specifically relatively recent Maya migrants from Chiapas, hotel workers, and the established Maya, both in the countryside and in Tulum. As for the Maya, the issues are not only economic, but also cultural and political." (Pi-Sunyer :19)
