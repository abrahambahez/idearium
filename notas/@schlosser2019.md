1. action is to be explained in terms of the intentionality of intentional action. In the debates that followed, the philosophy of action revolved largely around the notion of intentional action. For some time, the term \`agency' was rarely used, and if it was, it was usually taken to refer to the exercise of the capacity to perform intentional actions.

1. The contributions of Anscombe and Davidson have established a standard conception of action, and Davidson's work has provided the groundwork for a standard theory of action. At the core of the standard conception are the following two claims. First, the notion of intentional action is more fundamental than the notion of action. In particular, action is to be explained in terms of the intentionality of intentional action. Second, there is a close connection between intentional action and acting for a reason.

   It is important to distinguish the standard conception from the standard *theory*, which provides a causal account of intentional action and reason explanation. […] In this view, a reason explanation is an explanation in terms of mental states and events that cause the action and that rationalize it from the agent's point of view (typically by providing a means-end rationale). This theory is often called **“the causal theory of action”**.

2.1 The most serious problem for this standard theory has been the problem of deviant causal chains. Further, some have argued that this view altogether fails to capture agency, because it reduces actions to mere happenings.

2.2 It has often been claimed, and it is widely agreed, that agency involves the initiation of action by the agent.[[7](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/agency/notes.html#note-7)] But it has been controversial what this consists in. […] According to desire-belief versions of the view, initiation by the agent consists in causation by the relevant desire-belief pairs […] According to more recent versions, initiation consists in causation by the relevant intentions. […] Opponents of the standard conception argue, however, that an agent's power to initiate action cannot be reduced to the capacity to act intentionally and for reasons. […] On this view, reasons and intentions may have a strong and even a decisive influence on how an agent acts. But agency has its source in the power to initiate, and the exercise of this power cannot be reduced to the agent's being moved by reasons or intentions.

2.3 Frankfurt (1971) argued that the difference between persons and other agents consists in the structure of their will. Only persons reflect on and care about their motivations. […] his reflective evaluation of our motives usually results in the formation of second-order desires: desires that are directed at first-order desires (which are directed at goals and actions). When a person wants to have a certain desire and wants to be moved by it, then he or she is said to “identify” with the desire and its motivational efficacy. […] distinctively *human* agency, under the assumption that the distinction between persons and non-persons is, essentially, the distinction between human and non-human agents.

Building on his work on temporally extended planning agency (Bratman 1987), he argues that an agent's “self-governing policies” have the “authority to speak for the agent”, because they help to establish and support the agent's identity across time, and because they specify which desires are to be treated as providing justifying reasons in practical deliberation. According to Bratman, these self-governing policies explain what it is for an agent “to take a stand in favor of or against certain motivations, a stand that can itself be subject to reexamination and revision”

2.4 It seems, however, that there are beings that are capable of genuine agency and that do not possess representational mental states. We can distinguish here between three claims (and three challenges). According to the first, there are non-human beings that are capable of agency and that do not possess representational mental states. Second, there are many instances of human agency that can and should be explained without the ascription of representational mental states. Third, all instances of agency can and should be explained without the ascription of representational mental states.

2.5 There is, as we have seen, good reason to distinguish between different kinds of agency. The standard theory offers an account of what is, arguably, the most central kind of agency: intentional agency. […] This can be distinguished from higher or more refined kinds of agency, such as self-controlled, autonomous, and free agency, and it can be distinguished from more basic kinds of agency that do not require the ascription of representational mental states. [otros candidatos son] mental agency, shared agency, collective agency, relational agency, and artificial agency

According to volitionist theories of agency, mental acts of willing (choosing or trying) are also different in kind from overt bodily actions. On such views, mental acts of willing are furthermore fundamental, in the sense that they are the *source* of overt agency.

*Epistemic* agency concerns the control that agents may exercise over their beliefs (and other doxastic states).

*Shared* agency occurs when two or more individuals do something together (such as carry a piece of furniture or sing a song). *Collective* agency occurs when two or more individuals act as a group (in accordance with certain principles or procedures that constitute and organize the group).

The notion of *relational* agency derives from relational accounts of autonomy. According to feminist critiques, traditional accounts of autonomy are overly individualistic, insofar as they overlook or neglect the importance of interpersonal relationships in the development and sustenance of an autonomous individual

Finally, we turn briefly to the question of whether robots and other systems of artificial intelligence are capable of agency. If one presumes the standard theory, one faces the question of whether it is appropriate to attribute mental states to artificial systems [..] If one takes an instrumentalist stance (Dennett 1987: Ch. 2), there is no obvious obstacle to the attribution of mental states and intentional agency to artificial systems. […] According to Barandiaran et al. (2009), minimal agency does not require the possession of mental states. It requires, rather, the adaptive regulation of the agent's coupling with the environment and metabolic self-maintenance.
