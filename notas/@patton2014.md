Minimize output, and maximize outcome and impact.  
  
Your businesses strategy should give you some guidance about who to focus on to get the impact you want. I promise you that no business has the resources to make everyone happy—it’s just not possible.  
  
Don’t get me wrong here. Building more software faster is always a good idea. But it’s never the solution.  
  
One of the tough realities about software development is that there’s always more to build than we have time and money for. So the goal should never be to build it all. The goal is to minimize the amount we build.  
  
- First idea  
- First shared understanding of the problem (first storymap/prototype)  
- User research  
- Specific solution ideas  
- Backbone | lots of details  
- Priorization  
- Slice releases  
- Low-fi prototypes  
- Testing prototypes  
- Refined solution/delight ideas  
- *Minimize the amount of work!/ People are wrong about what they need*  
- Minimal product (not viable nor marketable)  
- Early adoption / beta customers  
- User story map refinement / story mapped backlog 

Our goal isn’t to get something built; rather, it is to learn if we’re building the right thing  
  
We can both read the same document, but have a different understanding of it.  

The best solutions come from collaboration between the people with the problems to solve and the people who can solve them.  

Use conversations as you build to fill in details and give feedback on what’s being built.  

very little of what we build is successful or has the real impact we hope for. I figure around 20 percent max. Then there is another 20 percent of things we do that are genuine failures—solutions that result in a negative impact  

If you don’t need to discuss it, you don’t need to map it.
