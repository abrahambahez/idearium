## Resumen

This paper defines closed virtual communities and outlines a brief guide for researchers (academics and students) who wish to engage in ethnographic studies of online communities, commonly known as a netnography. Although netnographies are relatively common in marketing research but represent a useful methodology for information systems research and business research in general. Additionally, this study outlines the major steps involved in a netnography, including entr√©e into the community, the gathering of data, and the analysis and interpretation of the gathered data. This study concludes with suggested guidelines depending on the sensitive nature of the closed virtual community.
