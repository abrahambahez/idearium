# don en el código abierto

Se dice que el [codigo-abierto](codigo-abierto.md) se sostiene a través de una cultura del [don](don.md) a través del [trabajo-voluntario](trabajo-voluntario.md) con el cual se gana prestigio a través de la [contribucion](contribucion.md) de calidad o cantidad.

Las contribuciones no suelen esperar retribución económica [@bergquist&ljungberg2001, 308]

Gifts are often not given to anyone in particular. They are made public (on web  pages) and thereby made available to anyone who cares to make use of them. An application or some information does not really become a gift until someone finds it and makes use of it. If a giver manages to get attention, people will turn the things offered into gifts, which means that a relationship is created between the giver and the user. [313]

On the Internet, however, the receiver is often unknown to the giver (Kollock, 1999). Gifts are placed on various homepages and ftp sites, and anybody can download a piece of information or an executable file and use it for various purposes. [314]

Rather than taking place in a world of objects or artefacts, gift giving in online communities
takes place in a world of information. There is no obligation to pay back but, for the ordinary
end-user, there is a moral obligation to pay back in the form of having some solidarity to the
community by praising the software, the project owners and/or the major contributors. [314]

El proceso de *donar código* tiene la peculiaridad de estar sometido a un proceso de [revision-por-pares](revision-por-pares.md) al usar métodos como el *pull request*
