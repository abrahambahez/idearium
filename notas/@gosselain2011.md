## Hightlights

> "Popular conceptions of'technology' tend to associate that term with activities governed by science and involving important'hardware' content; i.e., tools, devices, machines. Converseand implying more direct forms of engagements with materials. This view has been severely challenged for the last three decades. As stressed by Haudricourt (1964) and Sigaut (1987), the'technology' label should more appropriately designate the'science of techniques', which is above all'a science of human activities' (Haudricourt 1964: 28)" ([Gosselain 2011:2](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/7UZKAEZG?page=2))

> "a more general consensus is that techniques are essentially utilitarian in nature: they aim at ful"lling basic needs, in the most ef"cient and rational way possible. Such a'standard view' (Pfaffenberger 1992) relegates social and symbolic preoccupations to the back of a'technical core' supposedly governed by physical and functional constraints." ([Gosselain 2011:2](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/7UZKAEZG?page=2))

> "This view is not only at odds with the way in which non-Western societies conceive and engage in technical practice (see below), but also the way in which, from antiquity to modern times, techniques and technical actors used to be considered in Western societies."

La asociación entre tecnología y ciencia es un fenómeno histórico. Durante el siglo XVII se dio la laicización de la técnica, pero antes, en la historia occidental, los *proveedores de técnicas* [@gosselain2011, 244] eran asociados con magos e incluso con embaucadores. Eso implica que había otras dimensiones de la técnica, más allá de la utilitaria y la positivista. 8̂8e598

De acuerdo con Gosselain [-@gosselain2011, 246], las dimensiones sociales y simbólicas de las técnicas asumen que todas ellas forman *un sistema* dentro de una sociedad dada, que incluye diversas categorías como herramientas, dispositivos, acciones, materiales y conocimiento, todo interrelacionado tanto social como históricamente. Esto implica que sus elementos y sus combinaciones son *arbitrarias* en el sentido de ser *elegidas* entre varias opciones, pero también son *convencionales* en el sentido de corresponder a convenciones sociales más amplias. f̂3383a

> "In order to approach the social logic that lies behind technical choices, data collected through chaîne opératoire analyses must be compared at three levels: (1) elements constituting a given technique; (2) set of techniques developed by a given society, whose interrelation constitute a'technical system'; (3) relationships between a technical system and other elements of social organization (Lemonnier 1983)." ([Gosselain 2011:5](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/7UZKAEZG?page=5))

> "Iron-smelting and blacksmithing have been especially explored in Africa, where these activities are not only surrounded by rituals and taboos, but also associated with human gestation, fertility, and rituals of power in a variety of ways." ([Gosselain 2011:5](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/7UZKAEZG?page=5))

> "According to Rowlands and Warnier, the analogy between smelting and the reproduction process may be less indicative of a representation of fertility as a metaphor of iron-working, than of a context in which'smelters and smiths appear to have regarded themselves as facilitators in what we would call a natural process by which certain materials in nature transformed themselves into a substance which could be adapted to culturally useful ends'" ([Gosselain 2011:6](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/7UZKAEZG?page=6))

> "Comparing data collected in Nepal and East Africa in view of assessing the technical grounding of the symbols people'spin' around iron-working, Haaland et al. (2002) also point out that smelting and forging do not offer the same potential in that regard. The"rst centres on an invisible process of transformation in which objects and actions are strongly reminiscent of sexual intercourse and gender imagery. The second is a visible process through which the blacksmith gives shape to the bloom, an activity that'can be made relevant to understanding domains related to the theme of giving shape and creating order' (2002: 53)" ([Gosselain 2011:6](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/7UZKAEZG?page=6))

> "Pottery-making is also an activity'good to think' for those who practise it (Lévi-Strauss 1988). Following Lechtman, Sillar (1996) provides a fascinating illustration of a south-d processing, and mortuary practices are connected, both metaphorically and practically, through a series of transformation processes—digging, drying, soaking—that seem to structure both the technical and the social world (Figure 17.1). This symbolic emphasis on transformation in pottery making is a common phenomenon that has been commonly discussed in relation to African material (Berns 1993; Barley 1994; Gosselain 1999; McLeod 1984). Throughout the continent there exists what Barley calls a'potting model' (Barley 1994: 138), associating pots and pottery techniques to transitory states, fertility, death, and bodily cavities, and placing them as ef"cient tools for explaining natural processes or shaping cultural ones. For example, pottery-making is metaphorically associated with human gestation—in much the same way as iron-smelting—with a pot/foetus thought to result from the mixing of female (clay) and male (water or temper) elements, hardened in a "re/uterus, and born with the help of a potter/midwife, who may subsequently strengthen it through similar treatments as those used for newborns (see examples in Gosselain 1999). Similarly, potters, pots, and pottery tools and techniques may appear in puberty rites, marriage ceremonies, or funerals. The breaking of a vessel, for instance, may materialize death; yet pots may also serve as receptacles for ancestors and media for communicating with them (Berns 2000; Sterner 1989)" ([Gosselain 2011:6](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/7UZKAEZG?page=6))

> "Pots are also frequently likened to human beings," ([Gosselain 2011:7](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/7UZKAEZG?page=7))

> "In the Irian Jaya region of New Guinea, for example, large circular"res are used for cooking meat and tubers (with the help of heated stones), for heating blocks of stone in order to obtain plates from which axes will be roughed out, and for making salt. The connection transcends technical actions and devices, since both stones and salt are considered as the body parts of mythical heroes, classed among'hot things' (with pork grease), and cooked in highly socialized contexts. According to Pétrequin et al. (2000: 562-3), the underlying logic pertains to hot, dead organisms that must be cooked and distributed in a ritual anthropophagous context in order to reproduce the ideal functioning of society" ([Gosselain 2011:8](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/7UZKAEZG?page=8))
