# Paul Connerton
Académico británico y teórico cultural. Reconocido por una famosa trilogía sobre la [[memoria social]]

> On graduating with a first in 1960 he began research on the Marxist philosopher [Georg Lukács](https://www.versobooks.com/authors/297-georg-lukacs) at Nuffield College. Feeling he needed a literary basis to this work, Paul transferred in 1962 to Gonville & Caius College, Cambridge, to study English. In 1964, graduating again with another first, he resumed his research and from 1968 to 1972 was an unofficial fellow of Caius.
> 
> Finding Lukács increasingly distasteful, he abandoned his dissertation and instead qualified for a doctorate with his first published monograph, The Tragedy of Enlightenment (1980), an essay on the Frankfurt School of social theorists. By then he was launched on what became his career, or vocation, as a private scholar without private means.
