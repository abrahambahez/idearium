# Digital ethnography: Principles and practice

# Notas

## Conceptos relevantes

* **Experiencia**: relacionada con la sensorio-afectiva, el concepto de [sensorium](sensorium.md) es clave y va más allá de los 5 sentidos definidos en occidente. La experiencia digital y no-digital no son dos cosas diferentes, son la misma experiencia vivida simultáneamente y por tanto, lo digital y lo no-digital se retroalimentan
* **Prácticas**: impacto de lo digital en las acciones que se pueden realizar en todos los ámbitos de la vida, incluyendo lo privado-doméstico y lo público-laboral-social
  * The ubiquity of digital media in everyday life makes it at once obvious and easy to find, but at the same time it is difficult to separate out the ways that people use digital media from the wider rhythms and routines of everyday living and embodied senses of self.
* **Cosas** (cultura material y tecnologías digitales como *cosas*): El uso de "cosas" por sujetos y ambientes en el tiempo, la *apropiación* de las cosas
* **Relaciones**: Mientras que originalmente las relaciones sociales estaban definidas por ciertos grados de *proximidad*, las tecnologías digitales han posibilitado la interacción sin requerir distancia física, modificando la *[territorialidad](territorialidad.md)* de las relaciones: podemos estar cerca aunque haya distancias kilométricas entre nosotros. Estos cambios fundamentan la [co-presencia](co-presencia.md)
  * Expresiones de la paradoja: mientras la tecnología nos acerca con quienes están lejos, también puede alejarnos de quienes están cerca
  * Comunidades migratorias que revelan nuevos modos de "estar ahí" (migrantes de estratos bajos que pueden mantener más contacto con sus familias lejanas, migrantes de estratos altos -expatriados- que mantienen mucho de su forma de vida -incluso su idioma- en países lejanos)
* **Mundos sociales.** Este concepto no tiene una historia teórica muy larga, es usado por Pink [p. 131] como herramienta heurística: *By social worlds, we mean those relatively bounded – but never airtight – domains of social life. Ethnographers typically immerse themselves in these worlds by spending long periods of time with their research participants. The potential variation of these worlds is as vast of that of human sociocultural diversity. They can range widely from the worlds inhabited by bikers, surfers, farmers, nuns or herders, to those of online poker players, 3D virtual environments, Facebook groups or Weibo sers.* Dado que el concepto de red y comunidad puede resultar problemático para entender varios fenómenos sociales mediados por tecnologías digitales (¿son una comunidad o una red los *Indignados* del 15M?) se propone que mundo social puede ser un sustituto conceptual
* **Localidades**. Antes solían referirse a espacios físicamente situados, *microcosmos*, eventualmente han sido reemplazados por conceptos como *glocalidad* que desafían su dimensión física
* **Eventos**. Los eventos pueden entenderse de diversas formas, algunas útiles son como:
  * Relatos basados en múltiples puntos de vista que se rehacen en cada oportunidad añadiendo características que reflejan configuraciones socioculturales
  * Constelaciones de procesos que coinciden y luego no, pueden representar tanto eventos *mundanos* como espectaculares [p. 181]. Los eventos digitales son independientes de la *espectacularización* típica de la tv, ahora una evento relevante puede ser sobre un contenido mundano

### Conceptos secundarios en la obra

* [Ecologías comunicativas](https://palabraclave.unisabana.edu.co/index.php/palabraclave/article/view/5774/html) El estudio del entorno como posibilitador de comunicación entre diversos tipos de sujetos
* **Ritmos digitales** (proyecto de KPMG): investigar usos de lo digital como una práctica que está a lo largo del día a día de las personas
* **Prosumición**
* **Circuitos culturales**: as a framework that enabled cultural studies scholars to identify and explore the moments – production, consumption, representation, identity and regulation – wherein culture defines and shapes the meaning of media technologies.
* **Vida social de las cosas**: hacer la biografía de una cosa nos informa los diversos usos, contextos y significados que esa cosa tiene a lo largo del tiempo, esto es, su vida social
* **Doble articulación** (*double articulation*): las tecnologías son cosas que vinculan lo *privado* y lo *público* y facilitan la negociación de sentidos dentro y fuera de espacios domésticos [@pinketal2016, p. 89]
* **Teoría de la domesticación**: apropiación, objetivación, incorporación y conversión son fases por las que pasan las *"cosas domesticadas"*
* **Co-presencia**: las relaciones humanas están también definidas por cualidades y disponibilidades (affordances) de las tecnologías digitales, no sólo por la ubicación física u territorializada de la persona
* **Comunidades de práctica**: *refers to the ‘doing’ of community through active participation in sets of shared practices that bind people together (Lave and Wenger, 1991)* [@pinketal2016, p. 132]
* **Socialidad** (*sociality*) The concept of socialities refers, not to a specific type of social relationship per se, but rather to the qualities of social relationships. It is an open concept that enables us to recognise that social relations between people are multiple, can be fluid, and change at different rates. Hence, it also allows us to conceptualise how the ways in which people become related or ‘connected’ to each other through and with digital technologies might be similarly changing. [@pinketal2016, p. 135]
* **Conocimiento local** (*local knowledge*) Conocimiento compartido por un conjunto de sujetos vinculados (digital o físicamente) a partir de *puntos de encuentro*
* **Mundos virtuales** como *conjuntos de locaciones* [p. 161]

## Métodos de investigación

### Recreación videográfica

La recreación videográfica (*video re-enacted*) es una estrategia metodológica usada en contextos de etnografía digital. De acuerdo con [@pinketal2016, cap. 2]:

 >
 > A second method, the video re-enactment, invites participants to engage in a more detailed demonstration of everyday activities (Pink and Leder Mackley, 2014). In the project discussed here this included bedtime and morning routines, which were selected because they involve uses of media and energy (including switching on and off).

La recreación videográfica puede usarse para estudiar hábitos (rutinas matutinas, verspertinas, nocturnas), prácticas cotidianas [*day in the life*, cfr. @pinketal2016, p. 71]

### Video tour

El video tour es una estrategia metodológica usada en el contexto de la etnografía digital, de acuerdo con @pinketal2016 [cap. 2]:

 >
 > This method encourages participants to show the researcher their home and share the ‘feelings’ of its textures, air flows, temperatures, sounds and smells.

### Escenarios de uso

Los escenarios de uso son una estrategia metodológica usada en el contexto de la etnografía digital, de acuerdo con @pinketal2016 [p. 116]:

 >
 > Along with standard interview techniques, Hjorth used the ‘scenarios of use’ method – a deep interviewing technique, developed with Michael Arnold – that involves reviewing a participant’s typical day from the moment they wake up until the moment they go to sleep. Participants are asked to share information about when they use media and why, with interviewers asking further questions about the detail of the everyday and mundane. Interviews often last for two to three hours. Scenarios of use and re-enactments assist discussion of some of the tacit and familiar practices that can be overlooked in ordinary interviews. Alongside the scenarios of use method, participants were also asked to collate a diary over a month, including visual images such as screen shots, so that the researcher could gain a sense of some of the key phone applications that participants were using, as well as how and why they used them.

### Análisis de lista de contactos

El análisis de lista de contactos es una técnica de investigación o estrategia metodológica usada en el contexto de la etnografía digital para entender relaciones sociales mediadas digitalmente, de acuerdo con @pinketal2016 [p. 118]

 >
 > One of the key techniques used in the latter study was an analysis of individuals’ contact lists through a discussion of all the names and numbers saved in their phone (Horst and Miller, 2005). Participants documented each contact’s name and relationship to them, the last time they spoke with that person, what they talked about and how frequently they sent or received calls and messages from them. This contact list study also involved going through the entire phone, such as looking through pictures saved, screen savers, music, ringtones and other forms of customisation. Combined with the broader ethnographic research that Horst carried out between 1999 and 2002 and again in 2004, 2007 and 2009, the contact list study enabled Horst to understand the structure of relationships and networks activated through mobile phones. It also generated insights into some of the broader social implications of these structures, particularly gender relations in families, for understanding the meaning of the mobile phone in people’s everyday lives (Figure 5.3).

"Researching the digital rhythms of the home" (“Digital ethnography: principles and practice”, 2016, p. 70)

"ethnography generates embedded descriptions and understandings of how people use digital technologies and content in the contexts of everyday places, practices, relationships and routine. The researchers in this particular study coined the notion of `digital rhythms' to conceptualise these practices. Digital ethnography draws attention to the mundane and `hidden' dimensions of how and why digital media and content matter" (“Digital ethnography: principles and practice”, 2016, p. 70)

"The researchers employed a range of ethnographic methods, informed by digital and visual ethnography to develop a study. The methods were designed to get below the surface of everyday life and explore what people actually do and feel in situ. The researchers used immersive techniques to learn about people's everyday lives and digital rhythms through repeated visits to households over a four-month data collection period." (“Digital ethnography: principles and practice”, 2016, p. 70)

"Key methods included video recordings and re-enactments of pivotal moments of digital media use, dayin-the-life studies and exploring the production and circulation of content." (“Digital ethnography: principles and practice”, 2016, p. 71)

"Within the context of the broader Digital Youth Project, the development of the diary study by Horst and her colleagues allowed researchers working with youth in the context of homes, families and neighbourhoods to understand the intricacies of young people's everyday use of digital media when \`being there' is restricted by social norms, human ethics guidelines, and the different spaces, places and times in which youth engage with media." (“Digital ethnography: principles and practice”, 2016, p. 76)

"The ubiquity of digital media in everyday life makes it at once obvious and easy to find, but at the same time it is difficult to separate out the ways that people use digital media from the wider rhythms and routines of everyday living and embodied senses of self." (“Digital ethnography: principles and practice”, 2016, p. 82)

"entity through music, fashion and other forms of consumption (Gilroy, 1987, 1993 Hebdige, 1979, 1987). Framing the social or cultural as the locus of agency, they suggested that it was society rather than production processes that gave `things' meaning, and that `things' could be seen as artefacts that reflected relations of power, domination and inequality in society. A key example of the cultural studies approach to media technologies was outlined in Paul du Gay, Stuart Hall, Linda Janes, Hugh Mackay and Keith Negus (1997), Doing Cultural Studies: The Story of the Sony Walkman. In the groundbreaking study, the authors introduced the concept of \`circuits of culture' as a framework that enabled cultural studies scholars to identify and explore the moments – production, consumption, representation, identity and regulation – wherein culture defines and shapes the meaning of media technologies." (“Digital ethnography: principles and practice”, 2016, p. 87)

"Silverstone and Hirsch outlined four phases to describe the concept of domestication: appropriation, objectification, incorporation and conversion. Appropriation is when a technology leaves the world of a `commodity' and can be taken by an individual or a household and owned. It includes the whole process of consumption as well as the moment at which an object crosses the threshold between the formal and the moral economy (Miller, 1988). Objectification is expressed in usage but also, following Bourdieu (1984), the dispositions of objects in the spatial environment of the home. All media technologies have the potential to be appropriated into an aesthetic environment. Incorporation focuses on ways in which objects, especially technologies, are used. Technologies are functional. They may be bought with particular features in mind, but may also serve other cultural purposes in appropriation. Indeed, they often become functional in ways that are somewhat removed from the intentions of designers or marketers. Conversion is the process through which, in practice, the relationship between the household and the outside world becomes articulated. Technologies that are present in the household help to define and claim the household and its members in the `wider society'. This is often related to the ways in which technologies are `evaluated' within the moral economy of the household and the values of the wider society. As Silverstone and Hirsch and Morley (1992: 20) suggest, media technologies must be viewed as capable of great symbolic significance, investment and meaning that become `embedded in the structures and dynamics of contemporary consumer culture' (see also, Postill, 2011)." (“Digital ethnography: principles and practice”, 2016, p. 89)

"the examples in this chapter highlight some of the" (“Digital ethnography: principles and practice”, 2016, p. 102)

"limitations of participant observation, as practiced in anthropology and cognate disciplines. For example, Tacchi notes that in her study of radio and domestic soundscapes, it was often not possible to sit around in people's homes waiting for people to engage with sound; this was particularly antithetical to those who saw sound as an important companion in their home. Tacchi adapted to this situation by developing relationships across a range of contexts and also developed techniques such as sound mapping to find different ways to talk about soundscapes and their meanings with participants. The time that Tacchi took to develop these relationships reflects the challenges of conducting research in middle- and working-class homes in England (e.g., Miller, 2001)." (“Digital ethnography: principles and practice”, 2016, p. 103)

"Data collected during fieldwork in Shanghai from 2009 to 2010 at Fudan University provided a perfect snapshot of the rise and fall of Happy Farm. Through ethnographic methods such as participant observation with students and their parents, along with focus groups, scenarios of use and interviews, we were able to gain a sense of the ways in which Happy Farm was helping students, parents and grandparents overcome geographic distance through co-present ambient playfulness within the fields of Happy Farm. For many of these students from predominantly working-class backgrounds, the socioeconomic mobility gained through education is being transferred in unofficial ways to their parents and grandparents through cross-generational media literacy. This is particularly prevalent in the uptake of social media games." (“Digital ethnography: principles and practice”, 2016, p. 121)

"By social worlds, we mean those relatively bounded – but never airtight – domains of social life. Ethnographers typically immerse themselves in these worlds by spending long periods of time with their research participants. The potential variation of these worlds is as vast of that of human sociocultural diversity. They can range widely from the worlds inhabited by bikers, surfers, farmers, nuns or herders, to those of online poker players, 3D virtual environments, Facebook groups or Weibo users." (“Digital ethnography: principles and practice”, 2016, p. 131)

"The concept of community creates a `feel good' sense of human togetherness, evoking a social world that is warm and supportive. As an academic concept, however, it is limited in its empirical application to describing social formations (Amit and Rapport, 2002; Creed, 2006; Pahl, 2005; Pink, 2008). As Vered Amit summarises: `Invocations of community do not present analysts with clear-cut groupings so much as signal fields of complex processes through which sociality is sought, rejected, argued over, realized, interpreted, exploited or enforced' (2002: 14). Amit identifies a slippage between the ideas of community as an actual social group and as an imagined category (ibid.: 18)." (“Digital ethnography: principles and practice”, 2016, p. 132)

"More recently, the notion of community has also been revived in Internet ethnography. A key example for our discussion here is Rob Kozinets' `netnography' approach (2010). Netnography has become fast established and discussed by ethnographers working online and offers a useful framework for some types of analysis. One of the key concepts that underpins netnography is that of community, along with the idea that communities can be found, and studied, online. Kozinets defines online communities as having both online (virtual) and offline (face-to-face) elements (ibid.: 15). He mobilises the term community in a specific way in that he suggests that it should be used `to refer to a group of people who share social interaction, social ties, and a common interactional format, location or “space” – albeit, in this case, a computer-mediated or virtual “cyberspace”'. He further proposes using a `continuum of participation' to define `community membership', involving \`self-identification as a member, repeat contact, reciprocal familiarity, shared knowledge of some rituals and customs, some sense of obligation, and participation' (ibid.: 10)." (“Digital ethnography: principles and practice”, 2016, p. 134)

"The concept of socialities refers, not to a specific type of social relationship per se, but rather to the qualities of social relationships. It is an open concept that enables us to recognise that social relations between people are multiple, can be fluid, and change at different rates. Hence, it also allows us to conceptualise how the ways in which people become related or \`connected' to each other through and with digital technologies might be similarly changing." (“Digital ethnography: principles and practice”, 2016, p. 135)

"The 15-M social world can also be conceptualised as a field (Postill, 2015). More specifically, as a movement-field or field of contention, that is, a highly dynamic political domain in which variously positioned field agents (activists, hackers, journalists, politicians, celebrities and so on) struggle over a small set of pressing issues and rewards, often through digital media. By contrast with more institutionalised fields such as art, sociology or journalism studied by Bourdieu and his colleagues, a movement-field (particularly in the digital age) is characterised by its mercurial dynamism, that is, by the swiftness and unpredictability with which it can expand, contract, mutate and migrate (Postill, 2011). Rather than a `community of practice' (see above) with its shared membership, the 15-M field resembles the `affinity space' of a massively multiplayer online game (Gee, 2005). This is an open, inclusive sociotechnical world in which \`players' can find highly diverse routes to participation and accomplishment, regardless of prior qualifications or social identity." (“Digital ethnography: principles and practice”, 2016, p. 142)

"While it is true that `social world' is a highly polysemic concept, it comes with fewer moral or normative strings attached in the ways that long-since established concepts such as `community' and `network' do. Unlike community, with its pleasant connotations of warmth and togetherness, or network with its suggestions of horizontality and connectivity, social world is a neutral, heuristic concept that invites empirical investigation and comparative analysis. Moreover, it is not associated with any ideological current, as is the case with community (communitarianism), and network (`networkism'; see Juris, 2008), again allowing the fieldworker to resist the temptation of prematurely labelling the social actualities under investigation." (“Digital ethnography: principles and practice”, 2016, p. 149)

"For instance, in his well-known essay `The Production of Locality' (1995), which emerged as part of the literature `after' the reflexive turn, the anthropologist Arjun Appadurai introduced some important questions relating to how localities and neighbourhoods might be conceived. He regards locality as `primarily relational and contextual, rather than as scalar or spatial', that is, `as a complex phenomenological quality constituted by a series of links between the sense of social immediacy, the technologies of interactivity and the relativity of contexts' (1996: 178). He contrasts this with the concept of neighbourhood, which he describes as the `actually existing social forms in which locality, as a dimension or value, is variably recognised' (ibid.: 178–9). Appadurai's argument is interesting because he seeks to dislodge the idea of locality from that of a physically grounded and demarcated territory. `What', he asks, \`can locality mean in a world where spatial localization, quotidian interaction, and social scale are no longer isomorphic?' (1996: 179). This problem, as we see in the next section, has endured throughout recent theoretical attempts to understand the relationship between the tangible physical environment and the experiential, invisible, and mobile elements of everyday life, and has similarly impacted questions discussed in other chapters of this book (particularly Chapters 4 and 6)." (“Digital ethnography: principles and practice”, 2016, p. 155) ## importante para tesis ##

"One of the most useful distinctions in the recent wave of discussions of place in human geography is developed in the work of Doreen Massey. She sees place as an `event' or a `constellation of processes' (Massey, 2005: 141). Massey's theory of place enables us to think beyond the ways in which place has often been defined as bounded in earlier work, towards the notion of place as \`open' and constantly changing through the movements of things (see ibid.). Using this notion of place as a way to consider how different things and processes come together to make place, we can subsequently redefine locality as representing environments as they are inhabited. As Sarah Pink (2012) has argued, place and locality are different. Locality as we use it here refers to an inhabited place. However, this does not necessarily mean that locality is a physical entity or category as it was in the sense of the Chicago School's neighbourhoods. Instead, localities as inhabited places generate particular qualities because they are forged precisely through the close relationships between their different elements. It is this closeness or intensity of their elements that makes them a coherent unit of analysis – in that they are somehow bound together into a unit that can be analysed. This also means that localities are knowable by people, in that they are places that are experienced as entities." (“Digital ethnography: principles and practice”, 2016, p. 157)

"An example from everyday life is the UK music-sharing website Last.fm. The site's algorithms distinguish two main categories of significant others, namely `friends' (i.e., contacts) and `neighbours' (people with a similar taste in music based on their digital track record, not unlike Amazon's recommendation system). There is even a `neighbourhood radio' based on the algorithm's `local knowledge' of taste neighbourhoods. Intuitively, the creators of Last.fm have recognised the crucial difference between two key sociological principles: proximity within a social network and proximity in taste (in this case musical taste). In effect, they have combined an algorithm-driven social network analysis with the correspondence analysis of Bourdieu's theory of taste (see de Nooy, 2003) to create two strong bonds between users and the site." (“Digital ethnography: principles and practice”, 2016, p. 158)

"We cannot answer all of these questions here in any detail, but clearly the notion of `being there' requires some unpacking. With the widespread adoption of digital media in recent years, we are now in a position to discern at least four fundamental ways of being in the field. First, one can be there physically, copresently, interacting with research participants face-to-face (or, indeed, side-by-side, back-to-back and so on; see Postill, 2008). Second, the ethnographer can also be there remotely, that is, via Skype, streaming, chat, Pads and other telematic media. Third, we can be in the field virtually, in a `third place' that is neither our present location nor that of our interlocutors, for example via a mailing list, a Web forum, a 3D real-time game and so on. Fourth, ethnographers (and their participants) can be elsewhere imaginatively, after the fact, through digital stories or images found on blogs, social media, video-sharing sites and so on."

"The creation of this geo-cognitive space also occurred through ritualised exchanges of gifts of technological forms. Indeed, for many of the young people in Horst's study, the personal computer became a symbol through which parents acknowledged that their children were growing up." (“Digital ethnography: principles and practice”, 2016, p. 168)

"The Slow City movement is based in Italy and its central website, www.cittaslow.org/, is associated with the movement's base there. However, it is an international site in many ways, including through its use of multiple languages, although text is dominated by English and Italian. The movement was founded in Italy in 1999, with the aim of extending ideas related to the Slow Food movement to towns, and its membership list in April 2014 stated that it had \`187 Cities present in 28 Countries in the World' (www.cittaslow.org/download/DocumentiUfficiali/CITTASLOW_LIST_april_2014_PDF.pdf)." (“Digital ethnography: principles and practice”, 2016, p. 170)

"The anthropologist Michael Jackson has used the concept of the event to account for how happenings are experienced and remembered, and how they are used to imply possible futures. Jackson's point that `multiple points of view' about what has happened emerge after the event (Jackson, 2005: 12) indeed resonates with the idea that ritual symbols were polysemic, that is, they had multiple meanings (e.g., Turner 1969: 41). However, it in fact takes us in a different analytical direction. Jackson's focus is not on events that are ritually repeated, but instead on an extensively documented example of an event involving election violence in Kampala, Uganda, reported in the Sierra Leone Web in 2003. He then undertakes an ethnographic archaeology of the event through considering the ways in which participants in his research described this event. Jackson argues that, `Events quickly and imperceptibly blur into and become stories' (Jackson, 2005: 11), and that in doing so they become what he calls `a window as it were, onto previous events that are all but forgotten and possible events that are already being anticipated or prepared' (ibid.: 12). He thus suggests for the emergent event a temporality where processes are not seen as cyclical but where `every event opens up an ethical space in which new directions become possible' (ibid.: 14). This approach therefore enables us to see an empirically identifiable event – such as an instance of election violence in the case of Jackson's work, or as we outline below, an art or activist event – as a research \`window' through which we might begin to investigate processes of societal transformation." (“Digital ethnography: principles and practice”, 2016, p. 181)

"Taking the notion of the event to a further level of abstraction can also enable us to use a similar approach to account for what we might think of as the unspectacular type of event. For instance, as we outline in one of our examples discussed towards the end of this chapter, TV viewing events. The human geographer Doreen Massey has suggested a processual definition of the event when writing about the \`event of place'" (“Digital ethnography: principles and practice”, 2016, p. 181)

"as a \`constellation of processes' (2005: 41) that changes over time. If we, following Massey, think of the event as a happening in which a series of things and processes, of possibly different qualities and affordances come together, and might subsequently then disperse, it is possible to understand both mundane and spectacular happenings as forms of event." (“Digital ethnography: principles and practice”, 2016, p. 182)

"n the context of digital media, events have come to be experienced and produced in new ways. Dayan suggests that this has led to further segmentation of television and the closer interrelation between news and media events whereby, `Any event can be turned into a media event through an addition of specific features' (Dayan, 2010: 29). He also identifies a power shift, noting that, `Instead of dominant media organising and conferring a hierarchy on the multiplicity of events, dominant events now serve as the contested ground for a multiplicity of media voices' (Dayan, 2010: 29). Building on this updating of the original concept, Rothenbuhler focuses away from the dramatic elements of media events to remind us of the possibility of the everydayness of media events, noting how `rituals are self-preserving and selfreplicating' (2010: 65). He emphasises an understanding of communication as ritual that employs established forms, applying this understanding to the analysis of radio in a way that takes the notion of media events beyond the `special' event to suggest that they `might not be so radically unique after all' since even `special as they are, [they] are still part of the continuity of communicative worlds' (Rothenbuhler, 2010: 72)" (“Digital ethnography: principles and practice”, 2016, p. 184)

"Digital ethnography explores the digital–material environments that we inhabit and how human activity and the environments in which it takes place are co-constitutive." (“Digital ethnography: principles and practice”, 2016, p. 185)

"As part of a larger study of lifestyle television and shifts in lifestyle, identity and consumption in South East Asia, Tania Lewis and Kiran Mullenhalli conducted ethnographic research in 2011 with twelve households in Mumbai, ranging from poorer households to upper- and lower-middle-class families (Lewis, Martin and Sun, forthcoming). The study examined the ways in which people were using lifestyle advice gleaned from television, a huge and growing industry in India." (“Digital ethnography: principles and practice”, 2016, p. 186)

In order to understand how digital media are part of people's everyday worlds, we also need to understand other aspects of their worlds and lives. In doing so, we might focus specifically on those domains of activity in which digital media are used rather than on the characteristics or use of media.

For the purposes of this book, to be reflexive can be defined as the ways in which we, as ethnographers, produce knowledge through our encounters with other people and things.

Posición 363

Unorthodox:

Posición 411

Indeed, our wider argument is that, for a number of reasons, contemporary ethnography needs to be as Hine has put it, \`adaptive'

Posición 412

using adaptive methods vary: they can be a response to time limitations, the distributed nature of field sites, the nature of the analytical units or the (inter) disciplinary foci they take.

Posición 461

As new digital media technologies and new theoretical turns emerge there will be increasing opportunities to rethink digital ethnography.

Posición 464

Digital Ethnography is an emergent field of theory and practice; we do not view it as a static or defined area.

Posición 466

Researching Experiences

Posición 475

First, we deploy experience as an analytical window through which to understand experiences of a world of which digital media are a part. Second, we explore how the experience of digital technologies is part of the research process, considering how experience can be mobilised as a particular way of knowing other people's worlds through a digital ethnography approach.

Posición 478

we concentrate on sensory experience in order to show how different kinds of experience might be researched.

Posición 479

the sensory experience of digital media presence in homes in the UK; affective and sensory dimensions of women's uses of mobile phones in an Indian slum; and the creation of ambiance through engagements with haptic games in Australia.

Posición 483

John Dewey's understanding of experience as the flow of everyday life punctuated by \`moments of fulfilment'

Posición 487

Husserl's (1966) focus on consciousness, Heidegger's (1962) exploration of experience as fundamentally connected to situated ways of being in the world and Merleau-Ponty's (1996) emphasis on the body as the site of our knowledge of the world, are notable examples of how the study of experience has played a fundamental role in expanding our understanding of the human condition.

Nota - Posición 489

Experiencia y fenomenología están relacionados

Posición 492

Turner proposed as being between the unfiltered `mere experience' and the after-the-event defined `an experience' (Geertz, 1986; Turner, 1986). In response, Throop (2003) suggests that we might open up the definition to multiple types of experience

Posición 508

Ethnographers who have researched sensory experience have taken two different approaches. The first approach focuses on the five senses as they are understood in Western traditions– sight, hearing, touch, smell, taste– and their interrelationships.

Posición 510

The ways we use our senses, and the ways we create and understand the sensory world, are shaped by culture. Perception is informed not only by the personal meaning a particular sensation has for us, but also by the social values it carries. (Howes and Classen, 2013, see also 1991)

Posición 513

Walter J. Ong argued that cultures can be understood in and through the organisation of the sensorium– the operationalisation of our \`sensory apparatus'– precisely because it makes culture; if one can understand the sensorium, one can understand culture (1991: 28).

Posición 515

The second approach, which builds on the work of the anthropologist Tim Ingold (2000), invites us to consider experience as something that might not necessarily fit into verbal categories of expression– such as those used to describe the five senses noted above, and emphasises that neuroscientists do not necessarily see sensory experience as mappable onto these five concepts as sensory channels between the body and brain (see also Ingold, 2011; Pink, 2015). Sarah Pink has built on this approach to argue that phenomenological and neurological theories of sensory perception can enhance our ethnographic studies of the senses.

Posición 551

methods that has been called \`being in fieldwork'

Posición 553

There are a growing number of ethnographic studies that have attended to embodied and sensory experience of new devices, media and content. For example, work on haptic technologies (Paterson, 2007, 2009; Pink et al., 2010) sound, noise and silence (Bijsterveld, 2008; Born, 2013; Bull, 2000, 2008; Helmreich, 2007) and the visual, such as through camera phone studies (Hjorth, 2007; Ito and Okabe, 2005; Okabe and Ito, 2006; Pink and Hjorth, 2012), has demonstrated the importance of both attending to both other peoples' and ethnographers' own embodied and sensory experiences of and engagements with new media.

Posición 579

researchers often approach unseen elements of the experience by investigating how they are manifested in those routines and activities of everyday life that can be seen and discussed.

Posición 595

However, an ethnographic approach can yield different insights, and, here, the ethnographic materials were analysed in order to build alternative analytical approaches to everyday human activity and experience in the home. This involved using the concepts of movement, flow and presence to understand the experience of home. Three digital video methods were used in this research: the video tour, re-enactment and following participants as they undertook normal everyday activities (Pink and Leder Mackley, 2012, 2014).

Posición 598

Video tours involve a participant showing a researcher around their home (Pink, 2004, 2013). This method has been developed by Pink in a range of projects researching homes over the past 15 years. It is an adaptive method that can also be shaped to researching digital media in everyday life.

Posición 602

This method encourages participants to show the researcher their home and share the \`feelings' of its textures, air flows, temperatures, sounds and smells.

Posición 623

A second method, the video re-enactment, invites participants to engage in a more detailed demonstration of everyday activities (Pink and Leder Mackley, 2014). In the project discussed here this included bedtime and morning routines, which were selected because they involve uses of media and energy (including switching on and off).

Posición 639

Long-term ethnography with women and mobile phones in a Delhi slum cluster

Posición 642

Tacchi and Chandola used a range of methods, beginning with a communicative ecology study (Slater, 2013; Tacchi et al., 2007) that consisted of interviews in homes, on the street, in Internet cafes, public phone venues, and shops that sold a range of media and communication devices and services (including mobile phones, MP3 CDs, radios and videos).

Posición 703

Structures of power, gendered oppression and violence cannot be excluded from consideration in an ethnographic study of mobile phone use. They are important components of the context of phone use. Structures of power constrain mobile phone access and use for some people, while mobile phones also provide some of these same people with opportunities to subvert or circumvent them. Through exploring Rani and Monica's use of mobile phones ethnographically, it is impossible to ignore the broader and complex conditions of their lives.

Posición 709

Ethnographic moments of ambient play in Australian households

Posición 711

Mobile games have grown to encompass a variety of sensory modalities such as haptic (touch), locative media and sound. Through their multisensoriality, the various genres of mobile gaming afford new forms of ambience and play.

Posición 719

And yet, like ambience, sound is relatively overlooked in games studies despite its pivotal role in the generation of the embodied experiences of players.

Posición 723

Here, we need to understand ambience not just as an aural experience but also as an integral part of a game's texture, affect and embodiment.

Posición 784

Reflecting on Experience in Digital Ethnography

Posición 799

The first example also shows how researchers might develop a focus on the sensory experience of home.
