## Discusión

La relación entre la [cognicion-encorporada](cognicion-encorporada.md) y el aprendizaje puede variar en función de al menos dos factores: el tipo de integración del cuerpo en la tarea (incidental, integrado) y el nivel de involucramiento del cuerpo (bajo, alto).

 > Abstract: Research on learning and education is increasingly influenced by theories of embodied cognition. Several embodiment-based interventions have been empirically investigated, including gesturing, interactive digital media, and bodily activity in general. This review aims to present the most important theoretical foundations of embodied cognition and their application to educational research. Furthermore, we critically review recent research concerning the effectiveness of embodiment interventions and develop a taxonomy to more properly characterize research on embodied cognition. The main dimensions of this taxonomy are bodily engagement (i.e. how much bodily activity is involved) and task integration (i.e. whether bodily activities are related to a learning task in a meaningful way or not). By locating studies on the 2 × 2 grid resulting from this taxonomy and assessing the corresponding learning outcomes, we identify opportunities, problems, and challenges of research on embodied learning.

### Introduction

a large part of embodied learning research is concerned with instructional settings involving learners’ entire body
other researchers have focused on the potential uses of embodied phenomena besides full-body movement for educational contexts. These aspects include gesturing
or even minor implementations of EC such as assessing whether the display of human hands in animations can aid learning compared with disembodied arrow symbols
Although some theoretical models emphasize the role of extensive forms of bodily movement (such as locomotion) in embodied learning research (e.g. Johnson-Glenberg et al., 2014), we propose a more general model based on the dimensions of bodily engagement and task integration.

### Review

#### Embodiment and multisensory cognitive processing

One of the most influential theoretical approaches of EC has been Barsalou’s (1999) framework of perceptual symbol systems. This account suggests that humans use their sensory neural structures to create multisensory representations of their environment
This thread of research revealed that humans reuse those brain structures that are active during perception when mentally imagining an object or action
Barsalou’s (1999) model explicitly breaks with the idea of Fodor’s (1975) abstracted forms of symbolic representations as a description of the human conceptual system

#### Gestures

Experimental research conducted with young children is said to be a demonstration of the close relation between gesturing and language learning (Iverson & Goldin-Meadow, 2005). In the field of mathematics education, children were shown to benefit from observing teachers’ use of gestures as it increased the children’s inclination towards gesturing themselves (Cook & Goldin-Meadow, 2006)
An explanation for the positive effects of gesturing may be an eased generation of knowledge structures in long-term memory compared to teaching methods relying solely on children’s verbalization
Furthermore, a number of additional recent experiments have shown increases in learning outcomes when letting participants perform gestures
Importantly, gesturing is not only relevant at a young age, but remains an important aspect of embodiment-based learning during later years

#### Physical and virtual embodied learning

a significant theoretical component of EC theory is the notion of enactment (Gallagher & Lindgren, 2015). The bodily enactment of learning targets occurs when bodily movements are semantically related to these targets
As reading comprehension is considered to be related to EC (for an overview of this relation, see de Koning & van der Schoot, 2013), several studies demonstrated how reading comprehension can be enhanced when children physically perform a story they are reading (e.g., Glenberg, 2011; Glenberg et al., 2004)
A wide variety of research questions inspired by EC are investigated using digital learning media (for overviews, see de Koning & Tabbers, 2011; Lindgren & Johnson-Glenberg, 2013).

#### Taxonomies of embodiment in education

The seven main categories in the Melcer and Isbister (2016) system are: physicality; transforms; mapping; correspondence; mode of play; coordination; and environment. Each of these dimensions may be assigned different properties to categorize an embodied learning implementation (Melcer & Isbister, 2016). For instance, the dimension environment allows to categorize (components of) such an implementation as being developed as a virtual reality application, a mixed reality system, or as taking place in the non-virtual world
Five main categories are listed by Malinverni and Pares (2014): theoretical framework; design strategy; educational context; interaction design; and evaluation. These categories contain additional subcategories (Malinverni & Pares, 2014).
Johnson-Glenberg et al. (2014) developed a taxonomy for educational EC research. Their taxonomy comprises three factors: motoric engagement; gestural congruency; and perceived immersion
emphasize the role of locomotion as a major contributor to motoric engagement
they define gestural congruency as the degree of how well a gesture matches a particular learning item
perceived immersion is understood as it pertains to virtual reality and related technologies
The approach developed by Johnson-Glenberg et al. (2014) appears to be more appropriate for the analysis of educational embodiment research as it pertains to more basic building blocks of embodiment theory, such as the role of different types of movement
Although the taxonomy developed by Johnson-Glenberg et al. (2014) enables us to assess whether bodily resources are involved in a learning setting, the semantic nature of actions, and whether the learning environment offers immersive qualities, we consider other factors to be at least as important for determining whether and how a learning task can be regarded as being influenced by EC.
incidental

#### Integrated and incidental forms of embodiment

In order to describe an embodied learning setting in a meaningful way, we think that it is valuable to determine whether the intended form of embodiment is deeply integrated into the learning task or whether it is merely an incidental aspect.
We define integrated forms of embodied learning to be aligned with Wilson and Golonka’s (2013) notion of task-related embodiment manipulations and incidental forms of embodied learning as examples of those studies that Wilson and Golonka (2013) describe as dealing with bodily priming effects.
uch types of embodiment experiments have often been carried out in the context of judgment and decision-making (e.g. Ackerman et al., 2010), but more recently in the field of learning and metacognition
Research on embodiment often involves the manipulation of cognitive processes using incidental cues (e.g. Ackerman, Nocera, & Bargh, 2010), such as making information appear more important by presenting it on a heavy instead of a light object
Such types of embodiment experiments have often been carried out in the context of judgment and decision-making (e.g. Ackerman et al., 2010), but more recently in the field of learning and metacognition
For instance, Alban and Kelley (2013) were able to influence ratings concerning the ability to remember words by increasing the weight of the boxes that these words were attached to. Heavier boxes induced higher subjective ratings concerning one’s own ability to recall these words in later tests (Alban & Kelley, 2013). Skulmowski and Rey (2017a) extended this finding with studies indicating that wearing a heavy backpack during learning increased recall judgments and also heightened recall performance (at least when the learning contents were easy).
On the other end of the spectrum, we consider studies in which embodiment aspects are connected inseparably with a learning task based on Wilson and Golonka’s (2013) task-oriented view of embodiment. For instance, this can entail comparisons between learning settings built around bodily activities compared with those enabling learning without requiring motor activity (e.g. Johnson-Glenberg et al., 2014; Song et al., 2014) or presenting information for multiple sensory modalities compared with only providing information for one modality (e.g. Skulmowski, Pradel, Kühnert, Brunnett, & Rey, 2016). We call such manipulations integrated forms of embodied learning
Crucially, Mavilidi et al. (2015) demonstrated that an integrated physical learning task leads to higher learning performance than letting learners perform bodily exercises without a relation to the learning contents. A similar result was obtained in a study by Brooks and Goldin-Meadow (2016) that found an advantage for content-related movements over unrelated movements when teaching children mathematic
==task integration is an important factor for embodied learning==
the concept of task integration with a spectrum ranging from integrated to incidental is more general and thus can be applied to more types of embodiment research than gestural congruency.
Furthermore, categorizing studies using the dimension of task integration pertains to the more global aspect of how a study is designed rather than how a learning setting is used to implement embodiment
In contrast to incidental forms of embodiment, integrated forms of embodiment can pose additional challenges when designing embodiment experiments
A crucial factor in ensuring a high internal validity of such experiments is the appropriate choice of control groups
engagement
Bodily engagement and related notions of motor activation have been proposed as major characteristics of (educational) embodiment research in existing classification systems

#### Bodily engagement

As Johnson-Glenberg et al. (2014) divide their scale of embodiment into four levels, they assign each of these four levels specific ranges of motor engagement. The first two levels of their embodiment model only feature restricted levels of motor engagement allowing learners to watch animations (first level) or to interact with simulations (second level) using desktop computers or tablets while remaining seated
For the factor bodily engagement in our taxonomy, we would consider such forms of embodiment as lower levels of bodily engagement.
The third and fourth levels of embodiment in the model of Johnson-Glenberg et al. (2014) encompass letting learners perform bodily movements and locomotion, respectively. We define forms of embodiment qualifying for these two levels to be higher levels of bodily engagement in our taxonomy.
Several recent studies paint a positive picture concerning the inclusion of high levels of bodily engagement into learning tasks
==even very minor changes in interaction design towards bodily engagement can affect learning performance== (see Schwartz & Plass, 2014, for a similar conclusion)
Other research has revealed that interactivity can be more effective than merely letting learners observe an interaction (Jang, Vitale, Jyung, & Black, 2017) as well as having positive effects on working memory and affective variable
others assume that there may be ideal levels of interactivity
Kalet et al. (2012) demonstrated that a medical simulation involving a restrained extent of interactivity in which mouse clicking on instructionally relevant items would start instructional animations leads to better learning outcomes than versions with less interactivity (i.e. only being able to start and stop animations) or more interactivity (i.e. being able to virtually enact medical procedures by moving the mouse)
Another form of rather low bodily engagement occurs if an embodied learning setting offers learners an opportunity to observe movements instead of performing movements
Letting learners observe human movements has generally shown positive effects on learning compared with more static formats of instruction
A small number of recently published studies brought about results indicating no effects for observed movements (e.g. Ouwehand, van Gog, & Paas, 2015)
More generally, our review does not support the idea that higher levels of bodily engagement will in all cases lead to better learning outcomes than instructional designs featuring lower bodily involvement
A study investigating movement patterns in the context of dance training showed advantages for rehearsing with simplified dance moves of a to-be-performed dance (Warburton, Wilson, Lynch, & Cuykendall, 2013). Similarly, other studies argue for less (complex) activity during learning in order to save cognitive capacities ==el desarrollo incremental de habilidades del cuerpo va de lo simple a lo complejo==
Alban and Kelley (2013) discuss that stronger differences in weight may be required in order to find differences in memory performance. In a similar study design involving more pronounced weight differences induced by having the experimental group wear a backpack, significant differences regarding metacognitive judgments as well as memory performance could be found (Skulmowski & Rey, 2017a)
Moreover, Skulmowski and Rey (2017b) compiled several measures of cognitive load that can be used in embodied learning studies, such as behavioral, physiological, and metacognitive measures. Johnson-Glenberg and Megowan-Romanowicz (2017) emphasize that the nature of a learning test can greatly affect how well advantages of an embodied learning implementation can be detected.

#### Summary

![Matriz taxonómica de educación encorporada](https://media.springernature.com/lw685/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1186%2Fs41235-018-0092-9/MediaObjects/41235_2018_92_Fig1_HTML.gif?as=webp)

Research meeting the criteria for any of the four quadrants is faced with possibilities and challenges unique to each quadrant. Studies relying on low bodily engagement and incorporating only incidental embodiment manipulations may result in weak effects on some performance measures (e.g. Alban & Kelley, 2013). However, increasing the degree of bodily engagement can in some cases remedy this problem (e.g. Skulmowski & Rey, 2017a). A low degree of integration in itself may lead to worse learning results than an integrated intervention (Mavilidi et al., 2015). Turning to the dimension of bodily engagement, a large number of studies describing interventions with a lower level of bodily engagement, such as observing movements (e.g. Brucker et al., 2015) or performing gestures (e.g. de Nooijer et al., 2013), report successful outcomes. On the other hand, high bodily engagement has both been linked to learning gains (e.g. Johnson-Glenberg et al., 2016; Lindgren et al., 2016) as well as to the risk of cognitive overload (e.g. Ruiter et al., 2015; Skulmowski et al., 2016; Song et al., 2014). Some researchers have defined a medium degree of interactivity to be best suited for increasing learning performance (Kalet et al., 2012).
To conclude, the reviewed literature and taxonomy underline that neither should the degree of bodily involvement be used as an indicator of how “embodied” a form of instruction is (cf. Johnson-Glenberg et al., 2014) nor can it be expected that increases in bodily engagement automatically entail increases in learning performance (see Tran et al., 2017, for a related discussion).
