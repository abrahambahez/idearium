# críticas al ethos del hacker

## La frontera moral

La mayoría de las críticas recaen en los gurús que venden su estilo de vida o usan técnicas en el límite de lo ético para conseguir sus objetivos, como el caso de [Maneesh Sethi](https://hackthesystem.com/about/), fundador de [pavlok](https://pavlok.com/), quien pagó 8USD por hora a una mujer para que lo abofeteara cada vez que se distrajera, y en el futuro usó la [*técnica del escándalo sexual*](https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2012/02/06/sex-scandal-technique/) -nombre inspirado en Kim Kardashian- para volverse un DJ famoso en Berlin de la nada; o de [Tynan](https://tynan.com/regret/) aprovechando puntos débiles de los casinos en Las Vegas para enriquecerse (riqueza que le sería confiscada). esta es la filosofía de Sethi:

 > “The shortest path to a goal is not by doing what everyone else is doing. It’s often by doing the EXACT opposite.” To become a deejay in Berlin, he threw his own parties. To raise his own profile, he started a podcast and interviewed better-known life hackers. [@reagle, c. 3, § Privilege and Exploitation]

## Reproducción de la desigualdad de la delegación de tareas

En el más puro liberalismo social, algunas de esas prácticas llevan a la promoción de explotación intensa:

 > Yet just as Ben Franklin’s productivity was dependent upon the elided labor of his wife and slaves, the outsourcer is dependent on the labor of others.

Sethi, en el post sobre la técnica del escándalo sexual, dice:

 >
 > Let me tell you a story about one of my employees in the Philippines. I hired Klarc to help me build a habit: at 10:00 every day, he would call me and remind me to floss my teeth.
 >
 > One day, at 10:32, I received a Skype message. “Excuse me Mr. Maneesh Sir (Klarc always called me sir, even though I asked him not to), I’m so sorry I’m late. We were hit by a hurricane, and the whole village has no electricity! I had to run 8 miles to the next village so that I could call you!”
 >
 > Would you run 8 miles to remind me to floss? I was paying Klarc $2 / hr (but gave him a hefty bonus after this incident). What are you doing to make yourself so valuable [that an] employer would pay 10–20x that amount?

## Respuestas individualistas a problemas colectivos

 >
 > When life hacking is used to break the rules of our collective systems for personal advantage, little thought is given to those who are affected. Indeed, those left behind may be employed, literally, for menial drudgery by those clever enough to have just escaped it. But what of improving the system itself? Life hacking, simply, has little to say about this. Although life hacking practices could make one a more effective advocate for social improvement, life hacking’s focus is on hacking, above all, the self.

Esta actitud egocéntrica se enraiza profundamente en el *ethos* occidental del individualismo, del que forma uno de sus polos: en un extremo está el consumismo y la desmesura material, del otro, el moralismo ascético que desprecia lo colectivo, un ejemplo ideológico es la figura de Thoureau: <https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/19/pond-scum>

## Yagaiismo: el gobierno de los productivistas

 >
 > In Nancy Kress’s speculative world in which the sleepless ask what they owe the sleepers, much of the discourse is shaped by a philosophy known as “Yagaiism.” Kenzo Yagai, an inventor of an inexpensive cold-fusion power generator, believed that a person’s worth is based on what they could do well and that their only obligation was to abide by their agreements. As Yagai’s energy technology reshaped the world, so did his philosophy. A wealthy industrialist was a believer and opted to have one of the first sleepless children, hoping his daughter Leisha would be able to do well. As he explained to her: “People trade what they do well, and everyone benefits. The basic tool of civilization is the contract. Contracts are voluntary and mutually beneficial. As opposed to coercion, which is wrong.”

## Suele basarse en «ciencia popular», o [pseudociencia](pseudociencia.md)

 > Clearly, “sharpening the axe” can be a way of procrastinating. Instead of chopping wood, we experiment with novel methods and materials for improving the blade. But do we know that any particular gadget or method for sharpening actually works? As with self-help in general, we should not be surprised to learn that some claims are short of well founded. For example, could holding your urine, as was farcically suggested earlier, actually boost productivity? *Lifehacker* thinks so, based on a trawl of questionable research. “The Best Body Hacks to Boost Your Productivity at Work,” recommends that you “put your thumb in your mouth and blow to reduce stress,” “chew gum or coffee stirrers for added focus,” and “use your right ear for important conversations.” Most notably, “control your bladder to control impulsive decisions”; that is, take a big drink of water before a meeting so that the determination not to wet yourself will spill over.undefined

 > That post is an example of a larger problem with contemporary research, its reporting, and the self-help suggestions based on it. Consider the recent hoax study that concluded that eating chocolate accelerates weight loss. The study had real subjects (only fourteen), a typical methodology (subject to false positives), and a statistically significant result (with minuscule effects), and it was published by a rigorous peer-reviewed journal (so says the publisher).undefined This was a weak study best ignored, but many news sites reported the finding as fact, revealing problems with scientific rigor and journalistic vetting.

## La alianza con el capitalismo y el  [capitalismo-cognitivo](capitalismo-cognitivo.md)

 >
 > in 2004, two European scholars lamented these same philosophical foundations. In a much-discussed essay, UK media theorists Richard Barbrook and Andy Cameron warned that “a loose alliance of writers, hackers, capitalists and artists from the West Coast of the USA have succeeded in defining a heterogeneous orthodoxy for the coming information age.” They identified this “Californian Ideology” of the digerati as “an anti-statist gospel of cybernetic libertarianism: a bizarre mish-mash of hippie anarchism and economic liberalism beefed up with lots of technological determinism.”undefined Theirs was an astute ideological vivisection, even if their call for a European alternative was feeble.
