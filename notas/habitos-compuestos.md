# hábitos compuestos

Un [[habito]] compuesto es el tratamiento de un hábito de manera análoga a la idea del [interés compuesto](https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inter%C3%A9s_compuesto) con la finalidad de llevarlos a un crecimiento exponencial.

@reagle2019 [cap. 4, sec. The Science of Motivation] escribe:

>In _The Motivation Hacker_, Winter writes of a moment when his work on the app had stalled: “I want desperately to finish the app, but I couldn’t make myself do the work. I had more bugs than ever … and I could see that the iPhone app was many months away. Expectancy and Value were low, Impulsiveness and Delay were high, and my motivation was gone.”undefined He realized that if he wanted to finish, he would have to design an approach using the motivation equation. He began with success spirals, setting an easily achievable number of hours dedicated to working on the app every day. Early successes increased the _expectancy_ that he could achieve his goals. Importantly, he specified these goals in terms of effort, not outcome. To do otherwise courts failure because we have little control over what happens in the world. Focusing on inputs rather than outputs lessens disappointment, and the motivation hacker is primed to try again.
