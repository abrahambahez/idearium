"I seek to show how Urry's work advanced a sociology of space though his radical emphasis on mobile spatializations and relational space, which he first referred to as 'mobile sociology'" (Sheller, 2017, p. 2) [[giro-espacial]]

"Urry further developed the concept of mobilities through multiple collaborations, including work on systems of automobility (see Featherstone et al., 2004; Sheller and Urry, 2000; Urry, 2004), aeromobilities (Cwerner et al., 2009; Urry et al., 2016), mobile lives and network capital (Elliott and Urry, 2010), and mobile methodologies (Büscher and Urry, 2009; Büscher et al., 2011), among others." (Sheller, 2017, p. 6)

"the new mobilities paradigm challenged the idea of space as a container for social processes, and thus brought the dynamic, ongoing production of space into social theory across many different domains of research. But beyond that it did something more: it also challenged disciplinary containers and allowed sociologists, geographers, anthropologists, media studies scholars, artists and architects, and many others to move with each other in new assemblages that drew in ever-widening circles of interest, intervention, and creative instigation. The categories of separate social science sub-fields and disciplines were destabilized, put into motion, and the new mobilities paradigm spiraled outward, gathering and making possible these broader shifts" (Sheller, 2017, p. 6)

"First, it involves examining the place of movement within the very workings of social institutions and of social practices, those institutions and practices that form people's lives" (Sheller, 2017, p. 6)

"Second, work within the new paradigm examines five different modes of mobilities and their complex combinations that together make possible the institutions and practices of social life and its spatial practices" (Sheller, 2017, p. 7)

"corporeal travel of people" (Sheller, 2017, p. 7)

"physical movement of objects" (Sheller, 2017, p. 7)

"imaginative travel" (Sheller, 2017, p. 7)

"virtual travel" (Sheller, 2017, p. 7)

"communicative travel" (Sheller, 2017, p. 7)

"Third, these multiple mobilities necessitate distinct exemplars of research to capture and represent various kinds of movement and related spatial practices and mobility regimes." (Sheller, 2017, p. 7)

"Fourth, there is a complex assembly of movements and moorings within these mobility forms. Mobilities are organized in and through systems and such mobility systems presuppose 'immobile infrastructures' that are increasingly 'splintered' in terms of access" (Sheller, 2017, p. 8)

"Fifth, this paradigm emphasizes how social practices can emerge through 'unintended consequences' stemming from the ways people use, innovate, and combine different systems (and their spatialities)." (Sheller, 2017, p. 8)

"ncreasingly, mobility systems are based on expert forms of knowledge, but they are simultaneously vulnerable to failure, disruption, and cascading disasters when small things go wrong with big consequences (see Birtchnell and Büscher, 2011). Disasters also generate their own mobilities and immobilities, entrenching uneven spatial structures through the demobilizations and remobilizations associated with emergency mobilities" (Sheller, 2017, p. 8)

"Here we see a greater sense of non-human agency and complexity informing the new mobilities paradigm, and a less clear cut struggle between agents in processes of spatial structuration – much is out of our hands." (Sheller, 2017, p. 8)

"Sixth, the new mobilities paradigm involves analyzing diverse intersecting networks, relations, flows and circulation, and not fixed places. It suggests that it is crucial to bring in the dynamic, ongoing production of space via everyday social practices into social theory." (Sheller, 2017, p. 8)

"Finally, the world is not simply more mobile than ever, at least not in the sense of there being an enhanced 'freedom of mobility'. Mobilities are tracked, controlled, governed, under surveillance and unequal, especially because of the increasing power of big 'mobile' data." (Sheller, 2017, p. 9)

"Mobility struggles and contested notions of mobility justice are key concerns for the spatialities of the future as we come up against the limits of planetary ecologies, and it is apparent that mobilities re-make scale itself." (Sheller, 2017, p. 11)
