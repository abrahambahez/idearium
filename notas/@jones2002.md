"(1) The classic anthropological debate concerning the prioritization of etic or emic perspectives1 has been reconfigured in the form of a distinction between" (Jones, 2002, p. 56)

"‘objectivist’ and ‘subjectivist’ definitions of ethnicity (Burgess 1978; Isajiw 1974; Ross 1980)." (Jones, 2002, p. 57)

"It has long been recognized that such a simplistic distinction between ‘objective’ and ‘subjective’ definitions of ethnicity is problematic as it entails the naive pre-supposition of a value-free objective viewpoint located with the researcher, versus the subjective culturally mediated perceptions of the people being studied." (Jones, 2002, p. 57)

"(2) Definitions of ethnicity are also characterized by a tension between specificity and generality; that is between generic definitions which are considered to be too broad to be of any analytical use in the analysis of particular cases, and definitions that are so narrow that their comparative potential is minimal and their principal function is descriptive." (Jones, 2002, p. 57) [[la etnicidad es sensible a la escala]]

"Classificatory systems quite rightly vary depending on the issues they are supposed to address, and Moerman and Narroll are attempting to classify the Lue people for quite different purposes. Nevertheless, Moerman’s analysis does question the kind of universal system of cross-cultural classification Narroll is proposing by illustrating the significance of ethnic categories, such as that of the Lue, in the structuring of social relations and social practices in northern Thailand. For how useful is the category, ‘Northern Thai’, even as a basis for the cross-cultural comparison of social and cultural practices, if it holds very little importance in ongoing social life in this region? Furthermore, Narroll’s notions of ‘true’ Lue and ‘post’ Lue assume that culture-bearing units are relatively permanent entities that have an original ‘pure’ culture. This concern with static, pristine cultural entities is symptomatic of an essentially synchronic perspective of human societies embedded in western notions of cultural continuity and tradition (see Clifford 1988; Williams 1989)" (Jones, 2002, p. 59)

"Yet there are a number of problems with ‘subjectivist’ definitions of ethnicity. The insistence that all social phenomena involving the ascription of culturally based collective identity and the maintenance of group boundaries should be considered as ‘ethnic’, regardless of other differentiating characteristics, has led to the incorporation of a wide range of groups within the category of ethnic group (e.g. see Hunt and Walker 1974; Roosens 1989). These groups include: minority groups; indigenous groups; ethno-nationalist groups; groups based primarily on religion, language, political organization, racial categorizations; groups formerly regarded as ‘nations’, ‘tribes’, ‘minorities’, ‘cultures’, ‘racial groups’ and/or ‘religious groups’. In effect the concept of ethnicity has been used in the analysis of a wide range of groups subject to different kinds of classification, embedded in different forms of social organization, and constituted in diverse social and historical contexts." (Jones, 2002, p. 61)

"Irrespective of the many permutations discussed here, a conceptualization of ethnic groups as self-defining systems, and an emphasis on the fluid and situational nature of both group boundaries and individual identification, has prevailed in the last two to three decades. Within this broad generic definition, the analysis of particular ethnic groups has been largely concerned with the perception and expression of group boundaries; ethnicity is considered to be a consciousness of identity vis-à-vis other groups—a ‘we’/ ‘they’ opposition. The incorporation of a definition of ethnic groups as selfdefining systems within a theoretical framework focusing on boundary maintenance, the situational aspects of ethnic identification, and the movement of personnel across boundaries, has facilitated the analysis of the social dimensions of ethnic groups and filled a theoretical void in the analysis of inter-group relations." (Jones, 2002, p. 64)

"The ‘primordial’ perspective is one of two theoretical approaches which have dominated the literature on ethnicity in the last two to three decades, the other being known as the ‘instrumentalist’ perspective. The concept of primordial attachments was developed by Shils (1957) in order to describe the particular relational qualities inherent in kinship ties. He claimed that the significance of these primordial qualities is not merely a function of interaction, but lies in the ‘ineffable significance attributed to ties of blood’ (Shils 1957:122; my emphasis)." (Jones, 2002, p. 65)

"Similar explanations are adopted by other authors, who argue that ethnic identity has its roots in human nature. It is claimed that as ethnic identity is based on primordial attachments that are ‘given’ at birth, it is a more natural and fundamental form of identity than other forms of social identity (e.g. Connor 1978; Isaacs 1974; Keyes 1976). The cultural characteristics ascribed at birth are important elements in the definition of ethnic groups, and serve to distinguish ethnicity from other forms of group identity (see Keyes 1976)." (Jones, 2002, p. 66)

"To return to the overall primordial perspective, its main advantage is that it focuses attention on the strong emotions often associated with ethnic and national attachments, and the potency of the cultural symbols involved; aspects which are not adequately addressed by many recent instrumentalist approaches to ethnicity." (Jones, 2002, p. 68)

"(1) Primordialist theories result in a romanticization and mystification of ethnic identity." (Jones, 2002, p. 68) [[primordialismo]]

"primordialism itself is a mystical psychological disposition, almost by definition ‘shadowy and elusive’" (Jones, 2002, p. 68)

"Despite such problems, Stack (1986) and others argue that primordial approaches capture an essential aspect of ethnicity—the psychological and emotional strength of ethnic attachments. Yet there is no reason why such psychological dimensions should be shadowy or atavistic, leaving the analysis of this aspect of ethnicity devoid of any rigour or explanatory" (Jones, 2002, p. 68) [[primordialismo]]

"power." (Jones, 2002, p. 69)

"(2) Primordial approaches suggest that ethnic identity is a determining and immutable dimension of an individual’s self-identity, because the primordial attachments that underlie ethnicity are involuntary and coercive (Scott 1990:151)" (Jones, 2002, p. 69)

"(3) From a primordial perspective ethnicity becomes an abstract natural phenomenon which can be explained on the basis of ‘human nature’ with" (Jones, 2002, p. 69)

"little, if any, analysis of the social and historical contexts in which particular ethnic groups are formulated. In a simplistic form, primordial explanations suggest that ethnic groups are formulated in a social and political vacuum." (Jones, 2002, p. 70)

"The rapid growth of what can be broadly termed instrumentalist approaches to ethnicity has contributed to an understanding of the common processes and structures underlying the formation of ethnic groups and the politicization of ethnic identity" (Jones, 2002, p. 76) [[instrumentalismo]]

"(1) Many instrumentalist approaches fall into a reductionist mode of explanation whereby ethnicity is defined in terms of the observed regularities of ethnic behaviour in a particular situation" (Jones, 2002, p. 76)

"(2) The reduction of ethnicity to economic and political relationships frequently results in a neglect of the cultural dimensions of ethnicity (Deshen 1974:281–4). This neglect is a consequence of the idea that ethnic categories provide an ‘empty vessel’ into which various aspects of culture may be poured" (Jones, 2002, p. 77)

"(5) Finally, as a result of the tendency to define ethnicity as a politicized or mobilized group identity, and the neglect of the cultural and psychological dimensions of ethnicity, it is difficult to distinguish ethnic groups from other collective-interest groups (Hechter 1986:19)" (Jones, 2002, p. 79)

"In what follows, a similar processual and relational approach to the definition of ethnicity is adopted. Ethnic groups are culturally ascribed identity groups, which are based on the expression of a real or assumed shared culture and common descent (usually through the objectification of cultural, linguistic, religious, historical and/or physical characteristics). As a process ethnicity involves a consciousness of difference, which, to varying degrees, entails the reproduction and transformation of basic classificatory distinctions between groups of people who perceive themselves to be in some respect culturally distinct (Eriksen 1992:3)." (Jones, 2002, p. 84) [[procesualismo]]

"here have been a number of critiques of processual approaches" (Jones, 2002, p. 85)

"(1) The use of ethnicity as a central concept for the comparative analysis of a wide range of socio-cultural phenomena has been questioned (e.g. Blu 1980:219; Chapman et al. 1989:16–17; Pardon 1987:175). For instance, it has been argued that processual definitions of ethnicity, whatever their theoretical orientation, are ‘essentially empty’ (Just 1989:75), and could be applied to any ‘symbolically differentiated groups with a strong sense of identity’ (Blu 1980:224), such as gender, class and kin-based groupings." (Jones, 2002, p. 85)

"in contrast to ethnic groups, class and gender divisions do not entail the reproduction of classificatory differences between people who perceive themselves to be culturally distinct, instead they generally relate to divisions within a broad cultural grouping" (Jones, 2002, p. 85)

"in any particular analysis it is necessary to consider the intersection of different kinds of identity—ethnic, class, gender and so on—" (Jones, 2002, p. 85)

"and the ways in which they become institutionalized in different societies" (Jones, 2002, p. 86)

"(2) A number of critics have also argued that formal/processual definitions of ethnicity are ahistorical and fail to take into account wider social and historical contexts" (Jones, 2002, p. 86)

"Extrapolating from Bourdieu’s theory of practice, Bentley (1987:27) has employed the concept of the habitus as a means of providing an objective grounding for ethnic subjectivity which involves ‘the symbolic construal of sensations of likeness and difference’. The subliminal dispositions of the habitus, derived from the conditions of existence, provide the basis for the perception of shared sentiment and interest which ethnicity entails:" (Jones, 2002, p. 90)

"his theory of the relationship between the habitus and ethnicity results in a partial resurrection of the idea that ethnic groups constitute bounded social entities internally generated with reference to commonality rather than difference; an idea that was central to traditional models of the ethnic group." (Jones, 2002, p. 92)

"The recognition of shared sentiments and interests which ethnicity involves may be derived, at least in part, from doxic experience and knowledge in certain spheres of the habitus; similarities that cannot really be grasped in discursive form. However, the emergence of an ethnic consciousness, and the categories and symbols it entails, involves a break with doxic knowledge, due to the objectified representation of cultural difference involved in the expression of ethnicity (Eriksen 1993b:3)." (Jones, 2002, p. 95)

"This process can be illustrated by reference to a specific example, that of the construction of Tswana ethnicity in the context of European colonialism (see Comaroff and Comaroff 1992:235–63). In the process of interaction and communication between Tswana people and evangelist missionaries, both groups began to recognize distinctions between them; ‘to objectify their world in relation to a novel other, thereby inventing for themselves a selfconscious coherence and distinctness—even while they accommodated to the new relationship that enclosed them’ (Comaroff and Comaroff 1992:245). This objectification of culture is not a fabrication, an entirely instrumental construction. Tswana ethnicity is based on the perception of commonalities of practice and experience in Setswana (Tswana ways) in opposition to Sekgoa (European ways). Yet the form Tswana selfconsciousness takes in this context is different from the cultural identities that prevailed in pre-colonial times when they were divided into political communities based on totemic affiliations." (Jones, 2002, p. 95)

"However, ethnicity does not merely, as argued by Díaz-Polanco (1987), reproduce the very social conditions that gave rise to it in the first place, thus sustaining relations of domination and subordination, and dividing groups who are similarly disadvantaged. It can also form the basis of political mobilization and a source of resistance when dominated groups have the material and symbolic means to reject external definitions of their identity, and, importantly, when ethnic classifications in one form or another become the object and instrument of political struggle (see Devalle 1992:233, 239)." (Jones, 2002, p. 96)

"Thus, manifestations of ethnicity are the product of an ongoing process involving the objectification of cultural difference and the embodiment of those differences within the shared dispositions of the habitus." (Jones, 2002, p. 97)

"Ethnicity is a multidimensional phenomenon constituted in different ways in different social domains. Representations of ethnicity involve the dialectical opposition of situationally relevant cultural practices and historical experiences associated with different cultural traditions." (Jones, 2002, p. 100)

"From a ‘bird’s eye view’ the resulting pattern will be one of overlapping ethnic boundaries constituted by representations of cultural difference, which are at once transient, but also subject to reproduction and transformation in the ongoing processes of social life." (Jones, 2002, p. 100)

"Glazer and Moynihan’s (1975) position represents just one of many recent theoretical arguments which situate ethnic groups as the product of particular social and historical conjunctures. Along with a number of others (e.g. Bell 1975:141–2; Banton 1977:145–6), they have argued that the recent increase in the political salience of ethnic and sub-national groups in national and international contexts represents a new form of ethnicity in that ethnic groups are acting as economic and political interest groups." (Jones, 2002, p. 101)

"Others (e.g. Clifford 1988; 1992:108; Comaroff and Comaroff 1992; Friedman 1992:837) take a different frame of reference and locate the emergence of ethnicity in the context of European colonialism which has resulted in the displacement and fragmentation of pre-existing communities and the imposition of new categories of difference." (Jones, 2002, p. 101)

"The so-called ‘ethnic revival’ (Smith 1981) has been connected with a number of different, but in many instances interrelated, macro sociohistorical developments which impinge on local contexts in various ways." (Jones, 2002, p. 101)

"The communication of cultural difference both structures, and is structured by, the distribution of material and symbolic power between communities (see pp. 96–7 above). Thus, recent mobilizations of ethnicity in the negotiation of political rights may involve a transformation of the material and symbolic conditions in which ethnic relations are embedded, and the emergence of new ‘styles’ of cultural self-consciousness." (Jones, 2002, p. 102)

"To a greater or lesser degree these models contribute to the construction of an historical trajectory along which ethnic groups have developed from discrete, quasi-natural, primordial cultural entities into complex poly-ethnic, multidimensional interest groups in modern industrial societies." (Jones, 2002, p. 104)

"However, viewed as a unitary principle of human differentiation, the idea of a bounded, monolithic cultural cum ethnic unit is also a modern classificatory myth projected onto all of human history (Handler 1988:291). Ethnic groups are not neatly packaged territorially bounded culture-bearing units in the present, nor are they likely to have been in the past." (Jones, 2002, p. 104)

"processes such as the imposition of colonial regimes, the development of mass education and communication, and the emergence of ideologies of cultural relativism and self-determination all constitute new structures within which ethnicity is potentially reproduced and transformed." (Jones, 2002, p. 104)

"the identification of past cultures and peoples in archaeology has, for the most part, been dependent on the assumption that bounded, monolithic cultural entities (‘archaeological cultures’) correlate with past peoples, ethnic groups, tribes and/or races." (Jones, 2002, p. 106)

"(1) The question of the equivalence of archaeological cultures and past peoples was raised within the framework of culture-history." (Jones, 2002, p. 106)

"a desire to distinguish between archaeological cultures and culture in the ethnological sense was frequently expressed, for instance by Braidwood and MacKern in the 1930s and 1940s, alongside a demand for the development of alternative archaeological terminology (Daniel 1978 [1950]:319)." (Jones, 2002, p. 106)

"recent anthropological and sociological theories of ethnicity in emphasizing that ethnic groups are rarely a reflection of the sum total of similarities and differences in ‘objective’ cultural traits. Rather, they are self-conscious/selfdefining groups, which are based on the perception of real or assumed cultural difference." (Jones, 2002, p. 108)

"(2) Aside from problems concerning the relationship between archaeological cultures and ethnic entities, the actual existence of archaeological cultures has been questioned. Traditionally, higher level archaeological groupings, such as cultures or phases, were defined in monothetic terms on the basis of the presence or absence of a list of traits or types, which were often derived from the assemblages of a ‘type site’, or intuitively considered to be the most appropriate attributes in the definition of a particular culture." (Jones, 2002, p. 108)

"it has been argued that archaeological cultures can be generated out of a continuum of change, and that in many instances such entities are purely constructs devised by archaeologists" (Jones, 2002, p. 109)

"(3) Finally, a small minority of archaeologists have questioned the very existence of ethnic groups as fixed bounded entities." (Jones, 2002, p. 109)

"Studies have revealed that the boundaries of ethnic groups and the identification of individuals may change through time and from place to place, often as a result of the strategic manipulation of identity with relation to economic and political relations." (Jones, 2002, p. 110)

"Binford (1962:219) specified three different classes, ‘technomic’, ‘socio-technic’ and ‘ideotechnic’, relating to the kind of social domain in which artefacts have their primary function" (Jones, 2002, p. 110)

"Binford (1965:206–9) went on to outline three sources of assemblage variability: ‘tradition’, that is spatiotemporal continuity in stylistic variability derived from received knowledge about ways of doing things; ‘interaction sphere’, that is the distribution of a particular artefact or group of artefacts derived from regular and institutionally maintained inter-societal articulation; and ‘adaptive area’, that is a distribution of common artefacts arising from their use in coping directly with the physical environment." (Jones, 2002, p. 111)

"Basically these different classes of artefact and sources of variation are founded on a distinction between the ‘functional’ characteristics of artefacts, whether these are utilitarian or non-utilitarian, and ‘stylistic’ characteristics which cross-cut functional categories and are regarded as residual formal variation, a frequently quoted example being decoration on pottery vessels." (Jones, 2002, p. 111)

"in contrast to Binford, Sackett argued that style does not occupy a discrete realm of formal artefact variation distinct from function." (Jones, 2002, p. 112)

"Style, or isochrestic variation, therefore resides in all aspects of artefact variability, even those dimensions which appear to be explicitly functional" (Jones, 2002, p. 112)

"In contrast to normative or isochrestic theories, stylistic variation is not regarded as merely a passive reflection of enculturation within ethnically bounded contexts; rather it is actively produced, maintained and manipulated in the process of communication, and the mediation of social relationships. Such strategic manipulation of material culture is likely to result in discontinuous non-random distributions of material culture (see Hodder and Orton 1976), which are often the foci of interaction rather than relative social isolation and distance. Thus archaeologists cannot then assume that degrees of similarity and difference in material culture provide a straightforward index of interaction." (Jones, 2002, p. 115)

"Mackenzie has convincingly demonstrated that, through their use in everyday practice and in ritual symbolism, the meanings attributed to string bags play an active role in the construction of an individual’s social and cultural identity." (Jones, 2002, p. 118)

"Cultural change is generated by the intersection of the meanings embodied in the material and non-material worlds, and new contexts of interpretation and action in which agents act strategically on the basis of the structured dispositions of the habitus." (Jones, 2002, p. 119)

"Theories that focus exclusively on instrumental aspects of ethnicity fail to address a number of key issues. How are the commonalities of identity and interest associated with ethnicity generated? What is the nature of the relationship between ethnic identities and the cultural practices, or symbols associated with them? In short, what is the relationship between culture and ethnicity?" (Jones, 2002, p. 120)

"Ethnicity is not a direct reflection of the habitus, or of culture. The construction of ethnicity, and the objectification of cultural difference that this entails, is a product of the intersection of people’s habitual dispositions with the concrete social conditions characterizing any given historical situation" (Jones, 2002, p. 120)

"Certain aspects of material culture may become involved in the self-conscious signification of identity, and the justification and negotiation of ethnic relations." (Jones, 2002, p. 120)

"However, in contrast to instrumentalist theories, the approach developed here suggests that the ‘choice’ of distinctive cultural forms and styles used in signalling ethnic boundaries is not arbitrary. Rather, the self-conscious expression of ethnicity through material culture is linked to the structural dispositions of the habitus, which infuse all aspects of the cultural practices and social relations characterizing a particular way of life (see Burley et al. 1992:6–7)" (Jones, 2002, p. 120)

"The problem with Sackett’s argument is that he assumes that his isochrestic variation can be correlated with ethnicity. On the contrary, isochrestic variation in material culture can be usefully compared with Bourdieu’s concept of the habitus, although it constitutes a transformed and congealed representation of the generative structures of the habitus. As such, isochrestic variation ‘provides the resources for ethnic identity, and indeed for emblemic and assertive uses of style in general’ (Shennan 1989b:20), but neither isochresticism nor the habitus is equivalent to ethnicity." (Jones, 2002, p. 122)

"The analysis of contextual realizations of ethnicity is by no means entirely beyond the possibilities of archaeological interpretation if, as argued here, there is a relationship between the historically constituted dispositions and orientations that inform people’s understandings and practices, and the recognition and expression of ethnicity. As such, the way in which particular styles of material culture are meaningfully involved in the articulation of ethnicity may be arbitrary across cultures, but it is not random within particular socio-historical contexts. Ethnic symbolism is generated, to varying degrees, from the existing cultural practices and modes of differentiation characterizing various social domains, such as gender and status differentiation, or the organization of space within households (see Eriksen 1991).10" (Jones, 2002, p. 125)

"In particular, it is necessary to examine modes of social interaction and the distribution of material and symbolic power between groups of people, because, as argued above, ethnicity is a product of the intersection of similarities and differences in people’s habitus and the conditions characterizing any given historical situation. An adequate knowledge of past social organization is also important, as ethnicity is both a transient construct of repeated acts of interaction and communication, and an aspect of social organization which becomes institutionalized to different degrees, and in different forms, in different societies. Moreover, an historical approach is crucial, given the role of historical process in the generation and expression of ethnicity (cf. Olsen and Kobylinski 1991). Within a diachronic contextual framework it may be possible to pick up the transformation of habitual material variation into active self-conscious ethnic symbolism, and vice versa, on the basis of changes in the nature and distribution of the styles involved (Wiessner 1989:58); to reveal something about the contexts in which ethnicity is generated, reproduced and transformed, and to examine ‘the mobilization of group as process’ (Conkey 1991:13)." (Jones, 2002, p. 126)

"It has been shown that the construction of ethnicity is grounded in the shared subliminal dispositions of social agents which shape, and are shaped by, objective commonalities of practice, i.e. the habitus. Such subliminal dispositions provide the basis for the recognition of commonalities of sentiment and interest, and the perception and communication of cultural affinities and differences." (Jones, 2002, p. 128)

"Ethnic and national groups in direct competition over land frequently utilize the same basic culture-historical framework, as in the use of archaeology in support of competing German and Polish territorial claims (see Chapter 1). Furthermore, a culture-historical approach is often maintained even when those in power change, for instance from colonial regime to independent nation-state." (Jones, 2002, p. 136)

"In both archaeology and anthropology the definition of ethnic or ‘tribal’ groups on the basis of the culture concept has traditionally invoked an inventory of cultural, linguistic and material traits. As Devalle (1992:234) indicates, ‘the resulting picture has been one of people with a “museum culture”, uprooted from the deep historical field, devoid of dynamism and meaning’ (see also Morris 1988). The consequences of such an approach are not restricted to academic studies and reports, but are also manifest in areas such as political policy, administrative practice, legislation and heritage management." (Jones, 2002, p. 137)

"One of the most important arguments in this book has been that traditional definitions of ethnic groups involve the extraction of cultural ‘types’ from ongoing social practice in different contexts and at different times, and their location on a single plane for the purposes of analysis. This process of ‘methodological objectification’ substitutes a coherent, seamless whole in place of the often patchy, discontinuous, overlapping and contextualized praxis of ethnicity (cf. Bourdieu 1990:84, on mapping and genealogy). Such an approach denies the existence of any active engagement with ethnic consciousness in social practice, and serves to obscure the processes involved in the reproduction and transformation of ethnic identities. In effect, ethnicity becomes conceptualized as the historical legacy of a primordial, essentialist identity." (Jones, 2002, p. 140)

"Thus, it can be argued that recent theories lead to the deconstruction of monolithic and essentialist concepts of culture and identity just as these concepts are becoming a means of political mobilization and the basis for minority claims to land (and, in some instances, cultural property). However, this situation is more complex, because in land-rights cases indigenous populations often have to choose between an outright rejection of a culture-historical representation of their past, or a renegotiation of the ways in which their particular culture-historical trajectory has been interpreted by others (Ucko 1995b:10). The former option would in most instances require a change in the legal definition of indigenous land ownership, whereas in many cases the latter option will not satisfy a court of law which gives precedence to historical documents and archaeological facts, as in the case of the Mashpee land claim (see Campisi 1991; Clifford 1988:277–346). Moreover, such cases almost always involve the critical scrutiny of a minority group’s identity and history by the dominant society rather than vice versa, ultimately perpetuating the relations of power between groups (see Chapman et al. 1989:17–18). Minority groups are subjected to a relentless discourse which requires them, in one form or another, to possess a traditional, homogeneous culture and identity stretching in a continuous and unilinear fashion into the past. Many will inevitably fail such a requirement given that this discourse incorporates rigid expectations about the continuous and bounded nature of culture and identity, and fails to accommodate the social and historical processes involved in the construction of ethnicity (see Campisi 1991; Jacobs 1988)." (Jones, 2002, p. 142)

"However, ethnic identities are not free-floating constructions whereby individuals and groups choose to identify themselves and others in any way that suits them. Instead, particular ethnic identities, and the representations of the past associated with them, are produced in specific socio-historical contexts characterized by relations of power." (Jones, 2002, p. 143)
